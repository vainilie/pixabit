      "description":"Welcome to the Party Wanted Guild! We recommend reading our [FAQ](https://habitica.com/static/faq) to learn a bit more about Parties and how to find them. Here are some more tips for finding a Party or Party members:\n\n- **Let Party leaders know you’re looking to join**: On web, you can add yourself to a list of players looking for Party by selecting “Party” in the navigation and choosing “Look for a Party”. You’ll be added to a list of players that Party leaders can view and send invitations from.\n\n- **Party leaders can see a list of players looking for Party**: On web, Select “Find Members” from the Party dropdown in the navigation. This will display a convenient list of players that are actively looking for a Party and can be invited to join.\n\n- **This Guild is supplementary to the looking for Party list**: While we recommend looking for a Party and new members with the list, leaders can advertise their Party here for any solo players that are looking for a Party that fits their specific play style. Mobile support for the list is coming soon!\n\n- **How to send invitations with @usernames**: You can invite people using their @username that is displayed on all their posts. Copy it then go to your Party, click \"Invite\", and then paste it in. You can add multiples at once with one @username in each line, then click \"Send Invites\".\n\n- **You can use any language** to post to this Guild - you don't have to use English!\n\n- **If you want a non-English language Party**, you can also post to the [Party Wanted International](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/db4819dd-0efb-4290-989c-9f7625b59a3a) Guild where you can ask for a Party in any language except English.\n\n- **Don't ask people to send a private message (PM) to someone else** when you advertise your party. The person accepting PMs must post the party ad themself. \n\n- **Don't post here to advertise your party more than once every 24 hours.**\n\n- **Don't advertise Guilds or Challenges here.** You can use [The Bulletin Board](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/d6295936-7106-41d4-b90c-f22bdca3303b) for that.\n\n- **For questions about how to use Habitica**, post to the [Habitica Help: Ask a Question](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/5481ccf3-5d2d-48a9-a871-70a7380cee5a) Guild. Don't ask them here, not even questions about how to use a Party or do Quests.\n\n- **Don’t ask people to give you Gems or Subscriptions and don't offer to give people Gems or Subscriptions if they join your party.** Begging for real money items is a breach of the Community Guidelines, and offering gifts in your Party may encourage people to join and leave quickly. \n\n\nIf you are a Party leader wanting to get or share tips about running a party, you may like to join one or more of these Guilds:\n+ [Party Leaders Discussion Guild](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/dc4d8588-486f-4ace-87a5-1517e68217a1)\n+ [Habitica Party Roster Meeting Room](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/5189073f-56cd-4e2b-9cb6-817567371887)\n+ [Guild Leaders & Challenge Creators](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/0393624e-65f0-40c1-8e87-360955fcebca)",

Mindfulness can seem unrelated to emotional mastery at first, but in reality it is the skill set that allows all the other skills to work. Without good mindfulness skills, the other skills are less effective. \n\nThe other skill sets can be developed in any order. They are Emotion Regulation, Distress Tolerance, and Interpersonal Effectiveness.\n\nI have used and can recommend [this workbook](https://www.amazon.com/Dialectical-Behavior-Therapy-Skills-Workbook/dp/1572245131).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTwo important notes: \n1) Habitica is NOT the right place to go for medical advice.

      "description":"Thank you SO MUCH to the previous leader, @hakunaMarotta for giving me this guild!:grin::grin::grin:\n\n\nShare and review lists of habits, dailies, todos, rewards. \n\nThe challenges in this library serve mostly as examples and inspiration how your own tasks could look - they either contain tasks that many people are trying to do (for example, brush teeth, pay bills, exercise), or they demonstrate interesting ways to use Habitica (for example, gamifying tasks, making monthly tasks, making a \"gold bank\"). A list of the challenges broken into categories can be found on our [Wiki](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/The_Keep:Library_of_Tasks_and_Challenges). \n\nTherefore, the Library challenges are usually permanent (without planned end, winner, or prize). They are meant less for participating (though that is possible as well) and more for copying their tasks and customizing them for yourself.\n\nFuture lists could include scenarios like GTD, Homemaking, Freelancing, Writing, Musicians, Students, etc. as well as a main Library of Goals, and a Gamified Library.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTo add tasks from a Library challenge to your lists: \n1. **Join** the challenge. \n2. Then **leave** the challenge, choosing the *Keep Tasks* option.\n3. The tasks are now your own, and no longer linked to the challenge. You can customize them to your liking, change them and delete those you don't want.\n\nHave your own set of tasks you want to share? \n\nJust add a  new challenge to this guild, or discuss ideas in guild chat! Feel free to browse or add challenges to our [Guild Wiki](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/The_Keep:Library_of_Tasks_and_Challenges)!\n\nPlease keep all submissions friendly to all ages. \n\nThere are also various wiki pages containing a wealth of sample tasks - for example, [Sample Habits](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Sample_Habits), [Sample Dailies](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Sample_Dailies), [Sample To-Dos](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Sample_To-Dos), [Sample Custom Rewards](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Sample_Custom_Rewards), [Sample Tags](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Sample_Tags), [Gamifying Your Lists](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Gamifying_Your_Lists), and [Habitican Shared Task Lists](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Habitican_Shared_Task_Lists).\n\n______________________________________________\n\nNote - to keep this guild as useful as possible, we're trying our best to limit the number of people subscribed to the guild under 5000 so that notifications are readily available. Every few months, we'll do a quick purge of guild members who haven't logged in for at least 2 months. If you get kicked out, you're welcome to rejoin when you return to Habitica!",

While becoming famous for his paintings, most importantly the Mona Lisa, he was also active as an ***engineer, scientist, theorist and architect***. With all these qualities he fit perfectly into the Renaissance. Although later named that way this time span is known for the open-mindedness and emergence of lost knowledge. In this time it was a virtue for some men to become knowledgeable in all possible fields.\n\n___ \n\n\n\n Today the world is more complex and knowing everything in one field alone is impossible. However this shouldn't discourage us. Each one of us can acquire knowledge in more than one field. Thus we follow our heroes and start learning in multiple fields.\n\n\n\n We believe that successfully acquiring knowledge in more than one field is beneficial. It will help us see the world around us from a different perspective.\n\n> ##  We believe that every person has the power to gain knowledge and thus should be supported on their endeavour.\nWe believe that all humans are equally able to become a polymath. Thus it's important to support everyone regardless of personal features or background.\n\n`Join us on our adventure to learn more about the world and ourselves!`\n\n\n---\n## Guild rules\n1.    Don’t advertise other guilds or recruit for your party here. There are separate guilds for these purposes.\n2.    Be friendly to each other. The habitica [Community Guidelines](https://habitica.com/static/community-guidelines) are strict to keep a friendly atmosphere.\n3.    If you want to create a challenge please talk to  the guild leader in advance to make sure that your idea fits the guild. Challenges can only last for a maximum of 6 months. \n\n---\nbio by @kanga\n\n___ \n## Challenge links! \nPlease note all challenges are currently perpetual, with no gems to be won. We encourage you to leave monthly reviews to keep accountability of your goals and progress :) \n\n### Reading Challenges\n+ [Fiction book](https://habitica.com/challenges/5d0d72f0-feb0-46ce-be2c-5656a71fe1e0)\n+ [Non-Fiction](https://habitica.com/challenges/738b5438-0ed8-4b89-a4c3-3791646677de)\n\n\n### Declutter Challenges \n+ [Physical Decluttering](https://habitica.com/challenges/12885a4d-4caf-48e4-a971-e313ac5a5fda) \n+ [Digital Decluttering](https://habitica.com/challenges/8a89e9c8-bf33-4cc2-9375-79d164f60672)\n\n### Productivity/ Goals Challenges\n+ [Levelling up](https://habitica.com/challenges/caa3f1ee-89d8-47b6-8dc2-adb212476d18)\n+ [Self Care](https://habitica.com/challenges/4a12d9f6-50d9-411e-8cc2-c754e9e0e25d)\n+ [Self Taught - Start a Course](https://habitica.com/challenges/ffdc9cab-cc4c-4be1-8da0-35ccb9709ecf)\n\n+ [12 week year planning only](https://habitica.com/challenges/f90ec286-4c86-456b-ac44-e7f36e785c8e)\n+ [12 week year](https://habitica.com/challenges/e4af7138-b0d3-4707-8a2c-fc9406c63bba)\n\n### Seasonal Bucket Lists Challenges \n + [Seasonal Bucket List Spring](https://habitica.com/challenges/27bf3f88-72fb-43ff-ae26-fe8272b1776f)   :seedling:\n+ [Seasonal Bucket List Summer](https://habitica.com/challenges/2ebe93a4-b292-4d46-94c6-0da5520c23b8) ☀\n+ [Seasonal Bucket List Autumn](https://habitica.com/challenges/89af645c-bd3f-48ce-b91d-105753fc0c72) 🍁\n+ [Seasonal Bucket List Winter](https://habitica.com/challenges/08211770-a0f7-4af8-9f61-7b6da130c734) ❄\n\n\n### Journalling Challenges\n+ [Art Journal](https://habitica.com/challenges/400fc75d-8c1b-4c00-9a6f-2e388f4f8acf)\n+ [Stoic Journal](https://habitica.com/challenges/ed7e1853-aef5-4b19-9634-42f0094777df) \n\n+ [Write A Novel](https://habitica.com/challenges/f3921758-c023-491b-a8bf-46263a08e1fc)\n",

Work deadlines, personal finances, and family issues can take their toll on your sense of well-being. It is important to make time every day to gauge the challenges you are facing and respond to them in appropriate ways. In Mindfulness and Relaxation we discuss the techniques we use to slow down and live intentionally. Pull up a cushion or mat and join the circle.\n\nNew challenges are always welcome.\n***\n**Mindful Resources**\n\n+ [mindful.org](http://mindful.org)\n+ [zenhabits.net](http://zenhabits.net)\n+ [The Mindfulness Coloring Book](http://www.amazon.com/The-Mindfulness-Colouring-Book-Anti-Stress/dp/0752265628)\n+ See the [Meditation Resources challenge](https://habitica.com/challenges/8362a711-e522-4fd5-8ff2-d18dffa5db18) for more.\n\n***\n**Related Guilds**\n\n+ [Buddhist Sangha & Mindfulness Community](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/92e125ca-029d-4b25-a5a1-6aa1a3a15f1a)\n+ [Compassionate Communication (NVC)](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/c96a24a4-ad86-48b7-8e93-c628b3ddb015)\n+ [Live Life to the Fullest with Mindfulness](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/23489dff-9e05-4611-95f5-3aff7ad5b380)\n+ [Oneironauts](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/6ba29abf-3f1b-490a-b427-18ad992e6f79)\n+ [The Stoic Society](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/91b38d96-ccc6-4883-ac5e-733d02194ad9)\n+ [Qigong & MindBody Mastery](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/1b3d17e8-7247-43e7-8701-179775d38460)\n+ [Yoga Practititoners](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/592f6521-2980-4b3b-b684-113acbc9353b)\n\n***\n**Guild History**\n\nThis is one of the older guilds on Habitica. It began with a focus on the use of mandala coloring books as a meditative tool, and these challenges are preserved to this day. Over time the focus of the guild grew include to all varieties of mindfulness practices. Several challenges from private and now-defunct mindfulness guilds have also been preserved here.\n\n***Guild Leaders Emeritus***\n\n+ @jskwriting",

She has no power over us or *our* magical world.  \nWe specifically want to *encourage trans people and others who got hurt by the original author, or are critical towards her story, to come and join our magical world*, and help shape it so it becomes what we want. Including you!\n\nI personally have no idea how to even begin to unravel this whole mess with the Goblins.... (do you have an idea? Can you teach us?) But for now I definitely know:\n\n*Trans women are women.

      "description":"# ***With the discontinuation of guilds, we will be gathering on [Discord](https://discord.gg/DacFKtsNUE) so please join us there!!***\n\nHaving trouble with your reading? This guild not only deals with major problems such as time management, long TBR (To-Be-Read) lists, and buying too many books, but it also makes tackling these problems fun!\n\nThis guild attempts to solve your reading problems through quest-like challenges where you can fight monsters such as the vile Bookwyrm, Sqwandyr, and the Reidmorr. You will work together with fellow Habiticans to foster good reading habits and defeat bad habits. Most importantly, you'll have fun!\n\nIf you have any questions about the guild, just ask in the guild chat or check the [wiki page](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/The_Keep:Gamified_Reading).\n\n---\n\n## Challenges\n\nWe have many different monsters you can join in fighting to solve different problems. All challenges are compatible with each other, so feel free to join as many as you want!\n\n### [The Bookwyrm](https://habitica.com/challenges/6f1431bd-8931-436f-831b-955294ca2e74)\n\nThe Bookwyrm was first tested and loved in [The Bookworms](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/381f73d0-087d-4426-86df-f4cfd3d7ab4c) guild.\n\nThe Bookwyrm is a vile monster that attempts to make people read so much that they forget to do other things they should do. When it fails to do this, it tries to make you not read at all.\n\nThe goal of the Bookwyrm challenges is to accomplish your reading goals without the rest of your life getting pushed aside.\n\nFrom the blog of @loverofbooks: [The Bookwyrm Method](https://seewitheyesclosed.com/blog/article/bookwyrm-method)\n\n### [Tedium](https://habitica.com/challenges/3c1d404e-75f1-4a40-9209-86fba8f43a90)\n\nWhat do Les Misérables, Don Quixote, and Lord of the Rings all have in common? They're all so good, and they're all soooo long. If you've felt yourself get bored easily when reading longer texts, join us in our battle against Tedium!\n\n### [The Reidmorr](https://habitica.com/challenges/e08c91be-51de-4f2c-a7c7-12ea280bad83)\n\nThe Reidmorr feeds on long TBR lists. To ensure plenty of food, it shows people tons of books they want to read but never lets them get around to reading them.\n\n### [Tymeles](https://habitica.com/challenges/ca80972a-e1a5-4ea2-aaf9-ea5dc62a3096)\n\nWhile the Bookwyrm tries to get people to read when they should do something else, Tymeles persuades people into doing other things when they should be reading and then tells them that it’s okay because they don’t have enough time to read.\n\n### [2023 Reading Bingo](https://habitica.com/challenges/5e8dce28-224f-42c1-abd2-aea90df3fb67)\n\nThanks to the efforts of @KyraShadow the Reading Bingo challenge is live for 2023!\n\nHave you played Bingo?

One step at a time. \n\n**Tools We Use:** \n\n***Challenges and Synchronized Pomodoros***\n\n**1) 🎯 Weekly 10 Hours A Week Challenge and additional Challenges Created by Guild Members**  \nAnyone can start a challenge if you think of something that will help us get through our project. Scroll down to **Challenges** to check out the helpful challenges created by guild members!**\n\n**2) Synchronized :tomato:s**  \nWe also do :tomato: together.  aka **Synchronized Pomodoros (aka synch :tomato:)**  Anyone can start or join a :tomato:.  To synch with different time zones, we indicate the start with the number of minutes after the hour.  \n:30 means a :tomato: will start 30-minutes after the hour.  So if you're in San Francisco, the :30 pom would start at 2:30pm for you, and 11:30 pm for someone in Rome and 9:30 am for someone in Auckland.  \n\nThere are three ways to participate in a synchronized pomodoro.  \n\n**1. Join the [LTP Synchronized Pomodoro Room Cuckoo](https://cuckoo.team/Long.Term.Project.Guild)**  A synchronized Pomodoro room.  \n**2. Get the [Forest app](https://www.forestapp.cc) and create a group by PMing invitations.  Then you can invite people who are working to plant with you.**  \n**3. Synchronized Pomodoro in the LTP Guild Chat.  Here's a Step-by-Step Guide**   \n\nIn our guild, anyone can start a synchronized :tomato:.  \nA pomodoro, or pom :tomato:, is a unit of time that alternates 25-minutes of focused work with a five-minute break.   To learn more about the [Pomodoro Technique](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique) check out Francesco Cirillo's website. (He invented it!).  \n\n**Step 1:** Check the chat to see if anyone has already started a synch :tomato:, in which case you can join in.  \n**Step 2:** To start a synch :tomato: express the time you will be starting by indicating the number of minutes after the hour.  That way people from different time zones can synch with you.  So if you're starting at noon your time, you would write \":00\" in the chat.  \n**Step 3:** Write what you intend to work on in the chat along with the start time, and invite anyone who wants to work at the same time to join in.   \nIf you're joining a synch :tomato:  write a message to the person starting it and say that you’re joining them.  Write what you are going to work on during the :tomato:.  \n**Step 4:** Start working, and keep working for 25-minutes.  \n**Step 5:** During the 5-minute break, go back to the chat and report how your work went, and read other people's report.  If you decide to do another one, repeat starting with **Step 2**.  \n\nThat's it!  Happy Productivity!\n\nWelcome!🎈\n\nPlease introduce yourself, and tell us a little about the project you're working on.

As of April 2022, your moderator is @[Alder-Knight](https://habitica.com/profile/a7be1fc1-4b91-498e-8068-0c3a6fe019ea). Previous moderators have included @[Leafless](https://habitica.com/profile/40206b70-1950-4f36-9298-af04ccda81f7), @N3lson, @[citrusella](https://habitica.com/profile/2d6ef231-50b4-4a22-90e7-45eb97147a2c), and @[aaronux](https://habitica.com/profile/1ebdd587-575b-4ee4-a352-b1388a89bc5d) (who started the guild in 2013!).\n\n---\n\n**Guild Methods**\n\nDaily check-ins are useful tool for staying accountable to your sleep goals. Many folks post in the guild to say what times they are waking up and going to bed. Join a monthly sleep challenge if you'd like to track your progress alongside others!\n\nDifferent users have different ways of tracking their progress - most make their own systems and use emoji to keep it fun and colorful. If you are curious about anyone's system, it's probably fine to ask! Please be respectful, not everyone checks their notifications every day. :)\n\n---\n\n# **Active Challenges**\n\n+ ## [🌝🌞 August 2023 Early to Bed & Early to Rise Challenge](https://habitica.com/challenges/5761e66a-8690-4679-9540-4bc7f8b29218)\n+ ## [🥼😌🛌🏽 Science --> Sleep [August-December]](https://habitica.com/challenges/ca858f89-97d0-40a5-b3ee-597a6f729ab4)\n+ ## [Healthy Sleep 101 - August 2023](https://habitica.com/challenges/bddc2cbb-c5cd-437b-b347-4419f19e195a)\n\n---\n\n**Guild Housekeeping**\n\nAs of 21 June 2022, any user who has not been active on Habitica in 2022 has been removed from the guild. This is to get our numbers down from over 8k back under 5k so members receive notifications. These removals were NOT based on any kind of misconduct or as a disciplinary measure.

Day](https://habitica.com/challenges/68245ccf-d77a-4910-9037-8a7c0d9d7b36)\n\n🌱 As a personal note, I consider the most important challenge I host to be the vegan one. It not only benefits yourself, but other creatures, the animals, and the environment, in a major way every single day without taking away anything from you. It's as simple as choosing not to have animals be killed for your meals and we have that choice three times a day 🌱\n\n",

Let us know what paper planner system you use and any nifty tricks you have found that help you use both Habitica and your paper planner together.\n___\n\n+ Guild Leader: @shinymarigold\n\n\n\n+ Guild Seconds: @Lulufifi & @Kattastic\n\n\n---  \n\n**This guild acts a lobby for the Planner Addicts of the Frog Hunting Kind Guild which is a reporting guild for the Daily Frogs Challenge - If you would like to join please PM @shinymarigold to request an invite or ask for an invite in the guild chat. The new Daily Frogs Challenge is now up and running, and posted below with the other challenges.**\n\n---\n\n\n**Image & Link Sharing Policy**  \nPlease feel free to post links you find useful and links to images of your planners in the chat so we can see your awesome planning. Please acknowledge in your post if your link contains content that violates the [Community Guidelines](https://habitica.com/static/community-guidelines) (such as swearing, election partisanship etc). If a particular layout or link is especially helpful, then let me know and I will put it in the Useful Links section below (if it is a layout or personal link i will ask the poster's permission to do so first).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**How to Post an Image into Guild Chat**\n\n\nTo post an image to the guild, you can upload images to [Imgur](http://imgur.com/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/), [Photobucket](http://photobucket.com/), [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/), or other image hosting site of your choice, and then copy and paste the image's link into the chat box! For example, to upload pictures using Imgur, go to [Imgur](http://imgur.com/), click on `New Post` near the top and `Upload Picture`. Copy and paste the link from there into the chat box and add the appropriate markdown as required (as listed in the formatting help under the chat box) and any content warnings as required by the *Image and Link Sharing Policy* above then post to the guild!\n\n---\n\n**Useful Links**\n\n\n[Using Habitica as a Planner](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Habitica_Planner)\n\n[Official Bullet Journal Site](http://bulletjournal.com/)\n\n [Mini guide to Bullet Journals](http://lifehacker.com/the-bullet-journal-minus-the-hype-is-actually-a-reall-1786382012)\n\n[Using a Bullet Journal for Mental Health guide](https://www.buzzfeed.com/rachelwmiller/mental-health-bullet-journal?utm_term=.sv3Y9QNB3L#.nf0RdQ3A8y)\n\n[Bullet Journal tutorial video for people with ADHD (but also useful for the rest of us too!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkZEEQG6IVE)\n\n[Running tracker / log ideas for Bullet Journals](http://www.runnersworld.com/running-gear/11-impressive-bullet-journal-designs-runners-are-using)\n\n[Bullet Journal Your Way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nasMrmSumBU)\n\n[Printable papers - dot grid, lined etc](https://inspirationhut.net/printable-paper/)\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**PA Glossary**\n\n:notebook: **BuJo -** abbreviation for Bullet Journal \n\n:frog: **Froggodoro(s) -** a Pomodoro or a Pomodoro set that is used to focus on or start working on frog tasks. See *Frog Task* and *Pomodoro* below.\n\n:frog: **Frog task(s) -** That task or those tasks you have been procrastinating on and do not want to do. For frog emoji write : frog : without spaces. Name taken from the Mark Twain quote “Eat a live frog first thing in the morning and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day.”.\n\n:tomato: **Pomodoro(s) -** A period of 25 mins followed by a 5 minute break. After a set of four 'pomodoros', there is a longer break of usually 15-30 minutes. Borrowed from the time management system called the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) developed by Francesco Cirillo\n\n&nbsp;\n___\n\n\n**To Newbies of the Guild:**\n\n Welcome and well met. Just a word to starting your bullet journal. Don't get too involved with making it pretty. Don't feel like everyone has better handwriting than you do...Basically don't compare your current work with others. See something you like, Pinterest it for future inspiration. Maybe do a quick list of things you need to be better organized and start from there. The bujo is meant to be flexible to ***your*** needs. It's organic, it grows from you, you grow from it. It is addictive, if you are the artsy-crafty type you can go back when the pressure is off and decorate all you like.\n\n\n~ As written by the wise @Lady Moondreamer and copied here with permission ~\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n",

Scroll down to the end of the guild description to see who they are.\n___\n# :tada: `The Big Monthly Challenge` :tada:\n\nThe Big Monthly Challenges were originally created by @CatherineK and have been slightly modified by @LindyBlues.\n\nThis challenge suggests a celebration for each day. If you can't or don't want to celebrate that particular holiday for any reason, you are free to choose another and still check off that to do.  \n\nGood places to find alternative holidays include [Days of the Year](https://www.daysoftheyear.com/), [Checkiday](https://www.checkiday.com/), and [National Day Calendar](https://nationaldaycalendar.com/).  \n\nTo be eligible to win the Big Monthly Challenge, all you have to do is check off at least one to do. Posting in the guild is not required for this challenge.  \n\nPlease note that it is perfectly OK to celebrate the days out of order. The important thing is to celebrate!\n___\n\n# :tada: `The Little Challenges` :tada:\n\n# \"Little Challenges\" celebrate daily everyday holidays to bring you joy and help you learn something new every day. You can find all \"little challenges\" in the [Everyday Holidays Challenge Archive](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/b02faad1-5e01-4853-9065-0de4785aee4c)\n___\n# :question: Are we missing a holiday that you love?\n\nAny member who feels that any holiday deserves more attention is welcome to create a challenge, too, whether they want to post it publicly or just in the guild! \n\nGuild challenges are not required to have to have a gem prize, and they can be structured in any way the challenge creator desires. \n\n# **Please note that the guild leader does not take requests for challenge creation.**\n___\n# The Everyday Holidays Challenge Archive\n\nAll closed challenges are stored in the [Everyday Holidays Challenge Archive](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/b02faad1-5e01-4853-9065-0de4785aee4c).\n___\n# :gem: Thank You to Our Past Gem Donors!\n\n**Please note:** While we are grateful for all previous donors, please note that at this time the guild leader is  **not accepting gem donations,** as she will not be creating any new challenges until further notice.\n\nOur guild has been previously supported by the generous donations of:\n\n* @adlp\n* @artsandseances\n* Anonymous\n* Anonymous\n* @BradleyTheGreat\n* @KKPsychMom\n* @Lacermom\n* @LindyBlues\n* @Saiwa\n* @SuperSaraA\n\n### :gift_heart: **We are very grateful to all who have donated!**\n\n___\n# :trophy: :cat: :tada: \n# Everyday Holidays Party Animals!\n\n### We are very grateful for our **Everyday Holidays Party Animals**, who have made our guild awesome by creating well thought-out, helpful and interesting challenges for our members.

But if you judge a fish on its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing it's stupid.\"  \n-Albert Einstein\n\n\"The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing.\"\n\n---\n\n---\n\n# Welcome!\n\nCongratulations! I'm Head of House CatieWinter, and I'm delighted to welcome you to Ravenclaw House. Our emblem is the eagle, which soars where others cannot climb; our house colours are blue and bronze, and our common room is found at the top of Ravenclaw Tower, behind a door with an enchanted knocker. The arched windows set into the walls of our circular common room look down at the school grounds: the lake, the Forbidden Forest, the Quidditch pitch and the Herbology gardens. No other house in the school has such stunning views.  \n(However, if you want to see these views, you will have to find someone willing to share their chair). \n\n---\n\nCreative, sharp-minded, witty, and clever. You are an all-round intellectual person. You have great skill when it comes to academics, and chances are you will be a very successful person too. You are polite, patient but at times you tend to be a bit shy or soft-spoken. Even if you are not all of these things, we are glad to have you. \n\n---\n\nRavenclaws love leather-bound books and overstocked libraries. They're waking up at two a.m. to google that thing that's bugging them. They're journals with half the words crossed out, scribbles and ink stains and missing pages. They're stretching when you've been hunched over all day, rolling off the edge of a bed, burrowing in blankets. They're torchlight and held breaths and reverent whispers. They're the entire night sky and everything beyond it; the embodiment of the universe. They're desperate searches and hidden castles and ghost stories by firelight. They're the mystery of a dark corridor, the force of a whirlwind. They're the excitement of discovery, the rustle of crunched up paper. They're the last whisper before you fall asleep.  \n\n---\n\n**A Ravenclaw is a Person:**  \n- Who has intelligence, but is not necessarily good at schoolwork.  \n- Who enjoys intellectual conversations and thrives on discussion.  \n- Who has an analytical, curious mind; they constantly question.  \n- Who tends to observe more than participate in life.   \n- Who are highly introspective and independent.  \n- Who likes learning for the sake of learning.  \n- Who has an extremely selective work ethic.  \n- Who is logical, yet can be impractical.  \n- Who is not necessarily unemotional.  \n- Who is creative, witty, and wise.  \n- Who is not necessarily words.  \n- Who has a resigned cynicism.  \n\n---\n\n---\n\n## Common Room Rules\n\n- Never disturb anyone who is reading or writing.\n- Nobody is inferior to you, and you are not inferior to anybody.\n- Good humor, clear thinking, and realism are essential for doing work. \n- Never give advice where it is not needed.\n- Do not be afraid to question.\n- Keep your mind open to all points of view.\n- Do not judge others by their creative outlets. \n- If anybody needs feedback or someone to listen to them, let them have your time. \n---\n\n## General Stuff To Know\n\nIf you have suggestions for challenges, please post here and someone will make your wish come true, just as if it were magic (which it is :wink: )\n\nChatting is always encouraged, so feel free to chat, share, and encourage your fellow Ravenclaws. Please be respectful of your language, as there are many kinds of people here. \n\n**If responding to a riddle posted by someone, please PM them with what you think the answer is. This gives others the chance to answer if they don't come on before you answer (Ex. I came on one time to see a new riddle, but someone had already said the answer. I saw the answer before the riddle, so I didn't get the chance to guess). Of course, if you need some help, or many people are stuck, feel free to discuss.** \n\n---\n\n---\n\n## Prefect News\n\nHello Everyone! Our current prefects can be found on the common room bulletin board ~~guild summary~~. Occasionally new prefects are chosen. There will be a challenge, and the winner will become prefect. Please message me (@CatieWinter) with any questions. \n\n---\n\n---\n\n## Quidditch News:\n\n### We are not currently playing in quidditch.

note, I consider the most important challenge I host to be the vegan one. It not only benefits yourself, but other creatures, the animals, and the environment, in a major way every single day without taking away anything from you. It's as simple as choosing not to have animals be killed for your meals and we have that choice three times a day 🌱\n\n",

When we ask other guild members to \"badger\" us to stay on track, they often send cute (animal) badgers to help us out.   *(Because Habitica doesn't have a badger emoji, the friendly pandas :panda_face: have come to our help, and we thank them!)*\n\n**Dr. Meta:** \n\nOriginally from a challenge by @Ryan, \"visiting Dr. Meta\" refers to assessing your Habit setup and tweaking it to make it work better for you. (\"Meta\" as in stepping outside Habit for a moment to view it from a different level.)\n\n-----\n\n### **Poms, pom poms, pomming (:tomato:):** \n\nRelating to the 'Pomodoro' technique:  [Pomodoros](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique .\n\n\n**Clover** (:four_leaf_clover: : four_leaf_clover : ) :\n\nOne clover is equal to at least 100 minutes of work time in a 120 minute time period, for example, 4 consecutive poms.\n\n\n**Hibiscus** ( :hibiscus:  : hibiscus : )  *Hibiscus is a pink flower.* : \n\nUnique to the STAG guild, 1/2 a pom (12 minutes).\n\n\n**Cherries** ( :cherries:  : cherries : ) *note - 'cherries' must be plural.* :\n\nUnique to the STAG guild, 1/4 a pom (4-5 minutes).\n\n-----\n\n**Dolphin** ( :dolphin:  : dolphin : ) :\n\n**'Feeding the dolphin'** refers to getting your dishes done!  Some find their :dolphin: pets prefer to eat once a day, others split their meals into smaller portions.  *But they all get pretty grumpy if not fed!*  They will also eat 'fast food' and take care to remove trash in public places--just not too often!\n\n-----\n\n**DDR** (Deepest Darkest Red) :\n\nThese are your oldest To-Dos!  Time to clip off those red To-Dos that are cluttering up your Task Page!\n\n-----\n\nThe 'Cone of Shame' [see **Cone of Shame:**](http://pbs.twimg.com/media/A_jG9wtCAAIAy5c.jpg:large) :\n\nEscape the dreaded Cone by accomplishing any Tasks of Shame weighing you down. (Do this ONLY if it motivates you!)  *The Cone is not attached to a challenge, just start to wear it at your own choice in the Chat, and let us know what you need to do to 'heal' enough to be rid of it!*\n\n-----\n\nA word on :frog: *(frogs, referencing Mark Twain's concept of doing the unpleasant tasks first when possible)*.  Because several STAGs have sensitivities to this idea, In this guild we gently pat our frogs and they hop away!\"\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n### **STAG sub-guilds**: \n\nLink to the Short Term Goal Accountability OVERFLOW Challenge Chat guild:\n\n# [click here to go to OVERFLOW challenge chat guild](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/dc798b5a-8727-4cb0-962f-9dddf7e7ae39)\n\n\no This guild is for posting perfunctory challenge check-ins, reporting for Badger101/HoneyBadger/GoldenBadger and Dolphin :dolphin: dishes, Hoppy :rabbit2: Hair challenges, and it is also the home of the DFF (Daily Focus Finder) challenges.\n\nWe also have several private STAG sub-guilds for specific topics. \n\n## Ask in the main guild chat for an invite to any that interest you. Any subguild member can invite you!\nSome of them are more active than others, and some have their own additional challenges! \n\n**A Sett Up For Murder and other Nefarious Deeds - A STAG production**  \n\no  This is a fun subguild, where we try to guess what task one of us is doing, i.e., it's a (task) murder mystery guild!\n\n**Mindful STAGs**  \n\no This subguild may be of interest for those practicing mindfulness and meditation.\n\n**The STAG Games Room**  \n\no This is a place to play and find highly gamified and competitive challenges. Virtual board games, anyone?\n\n**Ye Olde STAG Kitchen & Academy of Cookery**  \n\no Many STAGs like to cook and share recipes.  Intended for Instructor and Novice STAG cooks alike.\n\n**STAG Career Center**  \n\no Some STAGs use this for job search encouragement and resources.",

In this guild, we try to create new, creative ways to use/play Habitica, by creating special rules for our tasks. Curious? Feel free to take a look and ask!\n\n&#160;\n\nIn this guild, everyone can create their [self-imposed challenges](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Self-Imposed_Challenges) to share how they modify their game! It is important to note that these challenges do not impact the game directly, instead, it gives the players special rules to make the game more interesting and fun! If you want to create one of these challenges, it is advisable to insert the [\"Challenge Information Form\"](https://pastebin.com/raw/2FXTDEwY) in the description of the challenge.\n\n&#160;\n\nAlso before you join a challenge, you should separate your actual task from the challenge's task with [tags](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Tags).

(September-November 2021)](https://habitica.com/challenges/ee43450e-877b-4c10-92ba-6e07b7d28acf)\n- [:snowboarder: :dart: Flow (June 2021)](https://habitica.com/challenges/6e412f4a-e00d-4a4a-901a-f5b03b1bf53b)\n\n### **Ongoing:**\n\n- [The co-manager for the 🏂 🎯 Flow and stress-free productivity guild](https://habitica.com/challenges/f935adb9-7f08-44b8-859a-c4fb2e818b21)\n\n\n### **These permanent challenges can be found under the guild description:**\n\n- :snowboarder: :dart: :eight::zero:/:two::zero: More result with less effort-- Focus on the tasks/goals that make the most difference\n\n- :snowboarder: :dart: :arrow_lower_right: Making a hard task easier\n\n- :snowboarder: :dart: :tomato: Hard :tomato: in the Flow\n\n- :snowboarder: :dart: :heavy_check_mark: Just get it done -- Good for easier tasks. \n\n- :snowboarder: :dart: :chart_with_upwards_trend: HARDCORE productivity -- Good for increasing your productivity in general\n\n- :snowboarder: :dart: :unlock: Stop self-sabotaging \n\n- :snowboarder: :dart: :blue_heart: Self-compassion -- \"Self-compassion\" is extremely important, underrated and misunderstood. \n\n- :snowboarder: :dart: :sunglasses: Done is better than perfect! -- For fighting perfectionism\n\nThe new challenges that will be permanent are under the guild description, they no longer have prises\n_________________________________\n_________________________________\n_________________________________\n\n## **Flow = the zone = complete absorption in what one does, state of the out-most productivity (with a dopamine boost as a bonus))**\n_________________________________\n\n## **The goal of this guild is sustainable and steady progress**\n_________________________________\n\n## **How to get into the flow (short version):**\n\n1) Set very precise goals. Break them down into actionable steps.\n2) Monitor progress, get feedback whenever you can\n3) Try to find a perfect ratio of skill/challenge\n\n__________________________\n\n\n## **How to get into the flow (long version):**\n\n**1**\\. **Clear goals** and sub goals/steps\n\n\"When you have clear goals, your mind doesn’t have to wonder what to do next. You know what you’re doing and why you’re doing it. Also, don’t focus on the finish line, focus on running the race, the NOW, the present moment. Many are getting distracted by their past, future, or self. Focus on the clarity of your goals. It gives you certainty.\"[4]\n\n\n**2**\\. **Immediate feedback** \n\n\"This trigger is a partner with clear goals. Clear goals tell us what we’re doing, immediate feedback tells us how to do it better. If we know how to improve performance in real time, the mind doesn’t go off in search of clues for betterment.\"[4]\n\nMonitor your progress in accordance with the goals (it's easier if the progress is visible). Ask the opinions of others if you need to. Habitica gives you some feedback when you check your tasks as done.\n\n**3**\\. The main concept of the flow is to try to achieve that **skill vs challenge** ratio, so that you feel challenged but not overwhelmed. \n\n![alt text](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Challenge_vs_skill.svg \"Challenge vs. skill\") \n\n## **Skill vs challenge ratio**: \n\n   - **If the task is too easy (and you feel bored)** you can increase challenge/difficulty in order to keep it interesting (Challenge **\":snowboarder: :dart: :heavy_check_mark: Just get it done\"**): \n      - increase speed, \n      - increase quality of work \n      - add a goal to find ways to enjoy the task (e.g. put some nice music), etc.\n\n   - **If the task is too difficult (and you feel anxious/frustrated or even feel like you might burn out)** you can decrease challenge/difficulty (Challenge **\":snowboarder: :dart: :arrow_lower_right: Making a hard task easier\"**): \n      - You can do it by breaking the tasks into manageable pieces (smaller steps/sub-goals), \n      - Work in your comfortable pace \n      - make a break when you start getting frustrated or tired,                                           \n      - ask for help if you need to, etc. \n\n   - **Don't work past your limit (to avoid burn out)**, but think of ways to move your limit. ( Challenge **\":snowboarder: :dart: :rocket: HARDCORE productivity\"**) \n\nYou can find these challenges in the description of this guild\n__________________________\n\n## **Dealing with a multitude of tasks (including difficult ones) (example)**\n\n**1\\.** Sort your tasks using [The Urgent Important Matrix](https://www.thecoachingtoolscompany.com/coaching-tools-101-what-is-the-urgent-important-matrix/) to minimize amount of tasks to focus on and to see the bigger picture ![alt text](https://tools.thecoachingtoolscompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Urgent-Important-Matrix-GRAPHIC-ONLY.jpg \"Urgent_vs_Important\")\n\n**2\\.** Create **tag \"focus now\"** (or with a similar name) to use when you need to focus (captain obvious at your service hehe). Put this tag on **7-10 tasks** max (all of which could be \"Habits\" and \"Dailies\" from Flow challenges ;p) and **just one \"To-Do\"** (the one that you need to focus on right now). \n\n**3\\.** This **\"To-Do\" task should be stated clearly** (clear goal). It's better to break it into clear **sub-goals and steps** (especially for hard tasks). Writing on paper usually works better, there's also some science behind it ;). \n\n**4\\.** Every time you **complete** one step or achieve one sub-goal, I click on **habit \":heavy_check_mark: I got it done\"** from the challenge [:snowboarder: :dart: :heavy_check_mark: Just get it done](https://habitica.com/challenges/f310f7e0-25b0-49ea-a284-7ee5708bb99d). You can also put the :heavy_check_mark: in front of the step or sub-goal on paper with a thick marker of your preferred color.\n__________________________\n\n## **Got questions? Ask!**\n\nPlease don't hesitate to ask in the guild! There are no dumb questions, we are keeping an open mind here. \n\nKeep me in the Flow as a leader of the guild, give me your feedback if smth is not clear (2-nd condition of the Flow) ;)\n\nThe FAQ article is coming soon...\n__________________________\n\n**People who have experienced flow, describe the following feelings:**\n\n- Completely involved in what we are doing - focused, concentrated.\n- A sense of ecstasy - of being outside everyday reality.\n- Great inner clarity - knowing what needs to be done, and how well we are doing.\n- Knowing that the activity is doable - that our skills are adequate to the task.\n- A sense of serenity - no worries about oneself, and a feeling of growing beyond the boundaries of the ego.\n- Timelessness - thoroughly focused on the present, hours seem to pass by the minute.\n- Intrinsic motivation - whatever produces flow becomes it own reward.[2]\n__________________________\n\n## **Disclaimer:**\n\nI am not a therapist, a psychiatrist or a psychologist. I do not assume any responsibility regarding your psychological state and anything regarding it. I merely try to provide some information and it is up to you what you do with it.\n\nThe same can be said regarding the challenges I create. You need to use your own judgment when applying any technique to yourself or trusting any source.

Be focused also works very well; you can make different categories and see how many Poms you completed in each one, but it only lets you select the length of your Pom in intervals of 5.* (Review by Dorkkunckle the Incredulous @hijodeganas112279)\n__________________________\n\n**Many thanks for contributing sources to:**\n\n- Arnavi Weiwei, a warrior of soul**\n- Niklaus Grädel\n- Dorkkunckle the Incredulous @hijodeganas112279\n- GeminiForce @GeminiForce\n\n__________________________\n\n**Donations are Always Welcome ;)**\n\nWe will be grateful for every :gem: \n\nHow to donate gem: \n\n**1**\\.

(Jordyward23)\nA: I'm not sure I can fully define the purpose but my personal vision is that productivity doesn't have to be forced and that's only about finding out *\"how\" to find paths/directions of less resistance for the processes that we want to be happening in order to achieve our goals*. For me, personally, it also means learning to be a kind friend to myself in terms of understanding what I need/want, what are my strengths and weaknesses (without judgment) and how to make my life worth living in terms of quality and meaning. \n\n",

AVISO: poste na taverna apenas uma vez por dia e apenas em algumas guildas para evitar spam.\nhttps://habitica.com/groups/guild/350c9b56-80d6-4758-8db7-71e879250b8d  \n3) Contacte o admin@habitica.com e expresse o motivo pelo qual manter esses recursos é necessário.  \n4) No seguinte link está o formulário de feedback do Habitica; coloque seu email e continue; Escolha “All Platforms” e “Social Spaces” e então continue, então você vai escolher “General Chat Interface” e deixar seu comentário sobre o porquê de você não querer que as Guildas e a Taverna desapareçam, e mencione que você não irá subscrever (ou se desinscrever) se isso acontecer. Continue, insira seu email e aceite a cópia das suas respostas para que você confirme que foi enviado.\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScPhrwq_7P1C6PTrI3lbvTsvqGyTNnGzp1ugi1Ml0PFee_p5g/viewform \n5) (Opcional) Adicione “keepthetavern&guilds” ao seu nick.  \n6) (Opcional) Use uma máscara de praga em significado à peste “perda de dinheiro contagiosa” que acontecerá no   \n7) Habitica sem a endorfina e produção de glóbulos brancos causada pela falta de socialização  \n8) (Opcional) Comunique-se com outros membros de Guildas em que você esteja sobre o tópico da Guilda em questão. O futuro é incerto, então vamos aproveitar o que temos.  \n\nGostaria de ter tudo isso em forma de desafio? Feito: https://habitica.com/challenges/93351ab1-e32b-4afe-8f17-adacc3701b3c\n\nVocê tem algum link ou informação importante sobre isso para partilhar?

I like to be able to put things away easily instead of trying to jam something into over-crowded drawers. I am also an environmentalist and really dislike excessive consumerism, waste, unnecessary packaging and throw-away culture. \n\nI also have a pretty severe case of eczema, which means that I have to be careful about what I put on my skin, what I eat, and how disciplined I am about taking care of myself. \n\nThis guild is a place to talk about minimalism and clutter, streamlining your life when you need to, taking joy in the things that you decide are worth spending you time or money on, making decisions about what is worth doing or not doing and having or not having. \n\nIt is also a place to participate in and talk about challenges to test out different kinds of minimalism to see if they make your life better at all! \n\n\nCurrently, the challenges associated with this guild are :\n\n1* [Minimalist Intoxication (August)]\n\nhttps://habitica.com/challenges/205e5539-1eca-44b2-8fc9-03333bde8723\n\n\n2*[ :crown::honeybee:Minimalist Skin Care (August)]\n\n\nhttps://habitica.com/challenges/8e3e3e4e-46a6-4b67-8d17-5614fa773ea3\n\n\n3* [:hourglass_flowing_sand: Minimalist Tidy (August)]\n\n\n\n\n\n4* [Minimalist lunches (August)]\n\n\n\n\n5* [🦜 Minimalist Distractions (August)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the past, I have also ran some challenges that I may run again in the future:\n* Minimalist Clothes\n\nI hope to have a couple running at any one time.

I (Kelafish, your humbly tentacled guild leader) wanted to thank each and every person who has participated in this guild, recently or not. You have made the darkness a truly lovely place.\n\nPlease, check out our Discord: https://discord.gg/mqP7bbqv\n\nNow, down to business. As we prepare for our inevitable descent into the void, I have some challenge-based announcements. You can find the August links below, but this will be the last month for these challenges. \n\nSince there is no guild to checkin, all check-in tasks have been deleted for now. However, you are welcome to message me (Kelafish) any time regarding the challenges, even if you just want to update me about your progress. I would be happy to hear from you! You can find the link to me as the creator in each challenge. (Please feel free to message friends in the guild chat and establish those lines of communication, too!)\n\nThe current plan is to **continue running the monthly challenges for as long as I have the gems for them.** After that, a permanent challenge will be created for anyone who likes the tasks and wants to take them on. There will be no end date for this new challenge, it's just a place to park our beautifully worded stabs into the cosmos.\n\nGuild challenges:\n\nCleanup: https://habitica.com/challenges/2c59def1-3f2f-45b1-a3c6-0eeff3a552fd  \n\nClean Every Day: https://habitica.com/challenges/934eeb5a-ec94-4293-8843-b6650bb9c7ec  \n\nStudy: https://habitica.com/challenges/716e4861-cdc8-4fe6-b2d5-0a844bb45e5e  \n\nThank you to our founder @Limenea for starting this group!

There is more than that to being a witch but at the core witchcraft (and witches) is simply about using the power of the universe and the mind to attract wants and desires. It’s about being in tune with Earth’s natural resources and using them to mystically quench a spiritual thirst.\n\nIf this sounds like you, or you are interested in learning more please come ask questions in the Witches of Habitica guild.

      "description":"The 'Weekly Goals in a Group' Guild is inspired from the realization that completing a weekly challenge is the best way to achieve important goals.  These aren't just any important goals, these are long-standing life goals, that don't have a sense of urgency behind them.   Yep, that's right, no boss, no pressure, no deadline...other than I know I want to achieve these goals for a happy satisfied life. \n   These are the tasks that sing, \"My life would be better if...\" and often have a series of boring small tasks leading up to the final important outcome.  \n   With weekly challenge goals as a priority, these important someday-if's, can get done because I'm choosing to create and live my best life. \n\nOngoing challenges in this guild: \n- Weekly Goal Groupies [Go Farther Together](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fAwLFpphhk-e2CWh5jQKN2OAf20DcT506Gyxvg--33w/edit?usp=sharing)  \n- Guild members are welcome to create group challenges that inspire them! \n- Gem donations are welcome and appreciated.\n\n**'Go Farther Together'** Put your habitica name and weekly goal in the group [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fAwLFpphhk-e2CWh5jQKN2OAf20DcT506Gyxvg--33w/edit?usp=sharing) If we beat that week's army, a gem winner is chosen (regardless of whether you beat your personal goal). If we beat four armies in a row, an extra gem winner is chosen (2nd gem winner).

      "description":"![Habitica June 2017 background \"Sandcastle\" by @traverpatri](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/habitrpg/images/5/5e/Background_sandcastle.png)\n\n*(Image: Habitica June 2017 background \"Sandcastle\", created by PattyTheWitch [@traverpatri](https://habitica.com/profile/19e84f58-eb68-44a6-a34a-54187cf0e606).)*\n\nYou've never created a challenge before and want to get it right before you publish it in the Tavern or another guild? You want to take your time building your challenge? You want to test something? You don't want to create a challenge alone, but together with others? You don't have the 4 gems necessary to create a private guild where you could do this? Or maybe you want everyone to be able to wander in and comment while the challenge is still under construction? You can do all this here! All the challenges in here are under construction or used for testing purposes. They are not meant for \"real\" participation.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- :put_litter_in_its_place: Please delete your challenges when you no longer need them here! A challenge can only be deleted by its creator and by Habitica admins. Let's hope we don't have to ask the admins to clean up abandoned, obsolete challenges here too often! (If an owner of a sandbox challenge hasn't logged into Habitica for 6 months or more, they will be sent a private message. If they don't respond to the message within a week, their challenge will be deleted.)\n\n- :dancers: When your challenge is ready to run, you can [clone](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Running_a_Challenge#Cloning_a_Challenge) it to the guild (or the Tavern or your Party) where you want it to run.\n\n- :file_folder: You can store a finished challenge template here for a while, too. But for permanent storage, please rather use one of the following places:\n    - The [:scroll: Library of Tasks and Challenges](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/adcd6903-e3c6-4c27-a0e9-21f2e7515cd6), where everyone can see the challenge and is allowed to use its ideas for their own challenges.\n    - Your own [private \"solo\" guild](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Guilds#Solo_Guilds), where only you can see the challenge. (If you stop using Habitica, the challenge will be lost to the public.)\n    - Another guild that fits the challenge's topic and doesn't mind storing challenge templates.\n\n- :scroll: For more information about challenges, please read these wiki pages:\n    - [Challenges](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Challenges)\n    - [Running a Challenge](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Running_a_Challenge)\n    - [Advanced Tips for Challenge Creators](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Advanced_Tips_for_Challenge_Creators)\n\n- :point_right: You might also want to visit the [Guild Leaders & Challenge Creators](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/0393624e-65f0-40c1-8e87-360955fcebca) guild (and look at their long link list).\n\n- :beetle: There are usually a few challenge bugs. You can find documentation about them by looking for [issues tagged with the **\"section: Challenges\"** label in GitHub](https://github.com/HabitRPG/habitica/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22section%3A+Challenges%22).\n\n- :speech_balloon: Using the guild chat for test-formatting complicated chat posts is ok if it happens rarely. But better (less spammy) test methods are: Sending messages to yourself, or using your own private one-person guild or one-person party, or using the text of a task, or even using a challenge description. If you test chat post formatting here nonetheless (maybe for a final check after already having used one of the other methods), please:\n    - Mark test posts as experimental: Add something like \"I just want to check how this post looks and if I got the formatting right!\" either to the post itself or to the one before or after.\n    - Delete test posts after you no longer need them. During your test, there shouldn't be more than 3 of your test posts in the chat at the same time. After your test, there should be none (except if they contain rare and complicated formatting that might interest others).\n\n- :pencil: The guild is already mentioned in a section of the wiki page [Running a Challenge](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Running_a_Challenge#Challenge_Sandbox). If, in addition to that, anyone wants to create a wiki guild page for this guild, feel free! (I won't have time for it any time soon.) \n\n---\n\n[Search terms](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Guild_Creation_and_Maintenance_Tips#Search_Terms) (to make it easier to find this guild): \n\n*challenge creation, challenge building, challenge testing, test challenge, challenge construction, challenge under construction, challenge cooperation, challenge teamwork, challenge proofreading, challenge workshop, complicated challenge, ...*\n\n(Please suggest more in chat if you can think of any!)",

While the term \"neurodiverse\" was originally taken up by those on the autism spectrum, it has expanded to cover many other neurodevelopmental conditions such as ADHD, dyslexia, dyscalclia, dysnomia, and dyspraxia. In recent times, it is often used to cover bipolar spectrum conditions, OCD,  and other forms of neurodiversity. \n\nThe aim of the Neurodiverity movement is to spread awareness that neurodevelopmental conditions should not mean that those who are neurodiverse should be excluded from society, and we certainly don't need a \"cure\" or a \"fix\". We are unique and important individuals with our own strengths and abilities, like every other human in the world, and deserve to be respected and treated so.  \n  \n### So who's this guild for? \nThis guild is a place for people from many different walks of life to connect, chat with, and support each other. Feel free to start a discussion, ask for advice, or share your thoughts! \n\n---\n\n**Note about Habitica Guild Chat:** At the moment, Habitica guild chats only hold 200 messages at a time, so it's recommended to try to gather your thoughts into one long message instead of multiple small messages. Please always follow the [Habitica Community Guidelines](https://habitica.com/static/community-guidelines).\n\nWe do have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/WGbz4cmZgj) which you can join and engage as much or as little as you'd like! Info-dumping about interests and asking for advice are welcome there. We aim to make it a safe space for those of us who are neurodivergent to connect and support each other! \n\n**Note:** The guidelines in our Discord server are different from those of Habitica. Please only join the Discord server **if you're 16 or over**. We understand that Habitica is open to those who are over 13, but the server has channels dedicated to sensitive and triggering topics which may be hard to handle without the help of a parent or guardian. There is **no graphic or 18+ content** allowed in our server however. Thank you for understanding! \n\n---\n\n### Resources\n\nHere are some quick links to resources which may be helpful. **If you have any suggestions, feel free to PM the guild leader @OptimumKitten to share them. We could always use more links to resources to help our neurodiverse community!** \n\n[Our Discord Server](https://discord.gg/WGbz4cmZgj)\n\n[ADHDers Guild on Habitica](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/17848f38-0418-4764-9fe8-91fdc9950e32)\n\n[Autistic Adventurer's Guild](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/a205dd09-4578-438b-a87a-275aa2461f2e)\n\n\n---\n\n\n[Adapting Habitica for Autism](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Adapting_Habitica_for_Autism)  \n  \n[Adapting Habitica for ADHD](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Adapting_Habitica_for_ADHD)\n\n[Adapting Habitica for Anxiety and Depression](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Adapting_Habitica_for_Anxiety_and_Depression)\n\n[How to Understand the Autistic Spectrum Comic Strip](https://the-art-of-autism.com/understanding-the-spectrum-a-comic-strip-explanation/)\n\n[ADHD Europe](https://adhdeurope.eu/)\n\n[ADDitude Magazine](https://www.additudemag.com/)\n\n[How to ADHD Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-nPM1_kSZf91ZGkcgy_95Q)\n\n[Translating ADHD Podcast](https://translatingadhd.com/)\n\n[Neurodiversity Sub-Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/neurodiversity/)\n\n[The Dyslexia Resource Website Resources Page](https://dyslexiaresource.org/resources/)\n\n\n",

      "description":"The Artist's Way is a book and course on fostering creativity written by Julia Cameron (and Mark Bryan).  We are all creative by nature, no matter how it often seems that the opposite is true, and the challenges here would be based on the lessons in the book.  The concepts can be used for your traditional art practice, or applied to the canvas of your life in general.  If you don't have the book, you can still join in; however, you will miss the depth the authors provide.\n\nPlease introduce yourselves in the chat, and tell us a bit about your creative projects, what you're working on, what you're struggling with, etc. Always be respectful. This is a place to encourage each other, give tips, and discuss the exercises in the book.\n\nAs an introduction to the course, I recommend you start the basic activity that will be the foundation of the benefit you get from the course. It's called Morning Pages, and it consists of three pages of brain dump that you do first thing in the morning. It's not a journal at all, and not meant to even be read (but you should keep them anyway). It's a technique for decluttering the mind and letting the creative pathways open up. They don't have to make any sense or serve any other purpose. I admit, I use the computer most of the time. I seem to think better that way, but the authors' recommendation is to write longhand, and NOT to correct or review what is going down onto the page. It is adamantly not \"writing\" in the sense of composing your thoughts or making a point. You're just using a pen and paper to unload your mind of the vast nonsense that plagues us all.",

Welcome to the family!*\n\n## Core Beliefs and Practices\n\n* We prioritize strengthening a positive, healthy identity\n* We practice identity-based habits \n* We commit to systems, not to goals \n* We plan big but make our steps small on purpose \n* We focus on sustainability of habits\n* We are cautious of inevitable boredom\n\n## New to the Guild?\n\n**:question: I just joined, what now?** \n* Hello, welcome! We're happy to have you! \n* Make an introductory post, share your goals, your roadblocks and what currently works for you!\n\n**:question: I didn't read the book, can I still join?**\n* Of course! You can also read some excerpts at [James Clear's website](https://jamesclear.com) \n\n**:question: What are check-ins?** \n* Typically in the morning, we encourage you to set your focus for the day. Here, we do 3 gratitudes and 3 tasks to zap. You are encouraged to make your check-ins anything you want, however, if you're not meeting them every day, talk to us and let us help you! You are also able to make check ins multiple times in the day to stay accountable. \n\n## Onboarding \n\n:zap: _Decide the person you want to be, prove it to yourself with small wins._\n\n:zap: To make a habit sustainable: \n1. Make it **obvious**. Select a trigger/cue. \n2. Make it **attractive**. Inject joy into your habits. \n3. Make it **easy**. What can you do to minimize friction?\n4. Make it **satisfying**. [How do you reward yourself or celebrate? Coins? Fist in the air?

We focus on being healthy mentally here, practicing gratitude and kindness to self is a great way to prove that to yourself.\n* **Why the focus on tiny habits?** There are tons of guilds that focus on other habits, we want to focus on making small, manageable steps towards a larger purpose. This is why we encourage setting upper-bounds and 2-minute habits.\n",

It can be as small as mailing a letter or making a call... \n\n\n&nbsp;\n---\n\n#### A Frog Field Guide\n*By @Cinnamon Toast and added to by @Lady Moondreamer & @indescribble*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n+ Small :frog: : Has good camouflage. Can hide under tasks that are not frogs, or under larger and more dramatically noticeable frogs, thus evading capture. Consequently often long-lived. Call is a high-pitched \"Oh, but surely you'd rather eat the big frog first.\"\n\n+ Green :frog: : Standard variety, lounges on lily pads just out of reach. Easily identified, but requires some effort to catch. Call is an annoying, twangy \"Aawww, do I have to? But I don't want to!\"\n\n+ Bull :frog: : Larger and tougher than the Green frog, this one lurks ominously atop a rock in the middle of the pond, and will require serious effort to catch. You're going to get muddy. Call is a deep, resonant \"Man, this is the worst!\"\n\n+ Mutant :frog: : A frog of any type that, when grasped, turns out to have extra legs or two heads, making it much more difficult to eat than you had expected. Can be so startling that you drop it, and have to start all over building up the gumption to recapture it.\n\n+ Tree :frog: : With it's bright green body and big red eyes, this frog perches high above making it easy to see but very difficult to catch. Cry is a defeated \"But I'll never reach thaaat!\"\n\n+ Fake :frog: - With a knack for mimicry, this frog gives an impression that it is much larger and more difficult than it appears. Once caught, however, turns out to be quite tame and quick to accomplish. Call is a mimicry of the Bull Frog being a deep, resonant \"Man, this is the worst!\", although once caught, call changes to a friendly \"Why was this hard?\".\n\n+ Poison Dart :frog: - Generally small, bright colored adorable looking frogs that look easy and attractive but when left too long develop a toxic whallup that can take long periods of time to recover from. Call is \"I'm tiny and cute, you can do me later.\" in sweet dulcet tones. *See also Lulufifi's description for the young of this toxic tribe.*\n\n+ Baby Poison Dart :frog: - Tiny, slow-moving and brightly colored, this species sits on the leaves of plants on the shore. It is easy to see and catch, but beware! When caught, it reveals its true nature. What you thought would be easy turns out to be both difficult and painful to handle. Call is a soft, low \"It'll only take five minutes!\"\n\n\n",

With that they discovered that they can use magical powers to bring out the true potential of the ninja, but at the cost that it tires them out. They also discovered that they can travel to the spirit world where Yo-kai lived. Without a thought, they immigrated to that location and easily gained full control of it. While humans believe we are extinct, they are wrong. \n\nToday, we have problems. A civil war broke out between the West and East regions of the spirit world, arguing what to do with the yo-kai their that causes bad habits. With that note, I am asking you to take a side and help end this war. I am asking you to train up your productivity to gain out the full potential of you, the ninja. Only then peace will return to the spirit world. \n\nThank You.\n\n@8-Bally; the Ninja Dojo's creater.  \n\nDisclaimer: \n\n1. This story and world is a work of fiction used to help motivate Habitica users in a fun way. \n\n2.  I am not the biggest expert on Japan's history and folklore, so I apologize if I got some facts wrong.\n\n3. Only people of the rouge class can join this guild. ***Just Kidding!

      "description":"\"Sensory issues\" refers to any problem integrating sensory information, whether being over-sensitive or under-sensitive. It can manifest by itself or be comorbid with many other disorders, including: Anxiety, AD(H)D, Autism, Misophonia, and OCD. (I myself have all of these.)\n\nSensory issues can cause problems with only one sense, or with all senses. Some examples of sensitivities include: clothing that is too tight, too loose, or made out of an irritating material; being touched, varying from strangers to loved ones, as well as from soft touches to firm touches; being crowded; feeling vibrations; and experiencing irritating light, whether too bright, or blinking/flashing, or being in an irritating spectrum; etc.\n\nIt can cause minor irritation to severe. You may not know someone around you has it if their case is mild and/or they are good at covering it up. But if anyone's ever snapped at you for clicking your pen, jiggling your leg, chewing with your mouth open, etc, you've probably met someone with some level of sensory issues. Please note: we do not choose to be \"picky\" or \"control-freaks,\" and we usually feel _extremely_ bad after we lash out at you, so please have patience.\n\nThis guild is for anyone who has sensory issues as well as anyone who supports those with sensory issues, whether it's just one person (friend or family) or many people (like a therapist). Please feel free to share helpful tips, tricks, resources, and encouragement. However, please keep in mind that no one here can diagnose, treat, or cure you--this guild is not made to replace care from a professional, but rather to provide community & acceptance. Thank you!\n\nI will be posting some resources later (as I find them).

      "description":"**Welcome Everyone!**  \nHow do you complete a journey of 10,000 miles?  One step at a time. \n\n**Tools We Use:** \n\n***Challenges and Synchronized Pomodoros***\n\n**1) 🎯 Weekly 10 Hours A Week Challenge and additional Challenges Created by Guild Members**  \nAnyone can start a challenge if you think of something that will help us get through our project. Scroll down to **Challenges** to check out the helpful challenges created by guild members!**\n\n**2) Synchronized :tomato:s**  \nWe also do :tomato: together.  aka **Synchronized Pomodoros (aka synch :tomato:)**  Anyone can start or join a :tomato:.  To synch with different time zones, we indicate the start with the number of minutes after the hour.  \n:30 means a :tomato: will start 30-minutes after the hour.  So if you're in San Francisco, the :30 pom would start at 2:30pm for you, and 11:30 pm for someone in Rome and 9:30 am for someone in Auckland.  \n\nThere are three ways to participate in a synchronized pomodoro.  \n\n**1. Join the [LTP Synchronized Pomodoro Room Cuckoo](https://cuckoo.team/Long.Term.Project.Guild)**  A synchronized Pomodoro room.  \n**2. Get the [Forest app](https://www.forestapp.cc) and create a group by PMing invitations.  Then you can invite people who are working to plant with you.**  \n**3. Synchronized Pomodoro in the LTP Guild Chat.  Here's a Step-by-Step Guide**   \n\nIn our guild, anyone can start a synchronized :tomato:.  \nA pomodoro, or pom :tomato:, is a unit of time that alternates 25-minutes of focused work with a five-minute break.   To learn more about the [Pomodoro Technique](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique) check out Francesco Cirillo's website. (He invented it!).  \n\n**Step 1:** Check the chat to see if anyone has already started a synch :tomato:, in which case you can join in.  \n**Step 2:** To start a synch :tomato: express the time you will be starting by indicating the number of minutes after the hour.  That way people from different time zones can synch with you.  So if you're starting at noon your time, you would write \":00\" in the chat.  \n**Step 3:** Write what you intend to work on in the chat along with the start time, and invite anyone who wants to work at the same time to join in.   \nIf you're joining a synch :tomato:  write a message to the person starting it and say that you’re joining them.  Write what you are going to work on during the :tomato:.  \n**Step 4:** Start working, and keep working for 25-minutes.  \n**Step 5:** During the 5-minute break, go back to the chat and report how your work went, and read other people's report.  If you decide to do another one, repeat starting with **Step 2**.  \n\nThat's it!

      "description":"\n#### What is a :frog:?\n\nA :frog: is a task that you have been putting off and do not want to do. It can be as small as mailing a letter or making a call... \n\n\n&nbsp;\n---\n\n#### A Frog Field Guide\n*By @Cinnamon Toast and added to by @Lady Moondreamer & @indescribble*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n+ Small :frog: : Has good camouflage. Can hide under tasks that are not frogs, or under larger and more dramatically noticeable frogs, thus evading capture. Consequently often long-lived. Call is a high-pitched \"Oh, but surely you'd rather eat the big frog first.\"\n\n+ Green :frog: : Standard variety, lounges on lily pads just out of reach. Easily identified, but requires some effort to catch. Call is an annoying, twangy \"Aawww, do I have to? But I don't want to!\"\n\n+ Bull :frog: : Larger and tougher than the Green frog, this one lurks ominously atop a rock in the middle of the pond, and will require serious effort to catch. You're going to get muddy. Call is a deep, resonant \"Man, this is the worst!\"\n\n+ Mutant :frog: : A frog of any type that, when grasped, turns out to have extra legs or two heads, making it much more difficult to eat than you had expected. Can be so startling that you drop it, and have to start all over building up the gumption to recapture it.\n\n+ Tree :frog: : With it's bright green body and big red eyes, this frog perches high above making it easy to see but very difficult to catch. Cry is a defeated \"But I'll never reach thaaat!\"\n\n+ Fake :frog: - With a knack for mimicry, this frog gives an impression that it is much larger and more difficult than it appears. Once caught, however, turns out to be quite tame and quick to accomplish. Call is a mimicry of the Bull Frog being a deep, resonant \"Man, this is the worst!\", although once caught, call changes to a friendly \"Why was this hard?\".\n\n+ Poison Dart :frog: - Generally small, bright colored adorable looking frogs that look easy and attractive but when left too long develop a toxic whallup that can take long periods of time to recover from. Call is \"I'm tiny and cute, you can do me later.\" in sweet dulcet tones. *See also Lulufifi's description for the young of this toxic tribe.*\n\n+ Baby Poison Dart :frog: - Tiny, slow-moving and brightly colored, this species sits on the leaves of plants on the shore. It is easy to see and catch, but beware! When caught, it reveals its true nature. What you thought would be easy turns out to be both difficult and painful to handle. Call is a soft, low \"It'll only take five minutes!\"\n\n\n",
