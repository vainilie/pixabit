This guild is for any level bakers to share whatever they wish about baking - rants about fondant, Great British Baking Show love, bread puns, grandma's best cookie recipe, baking tips, and more.

Anyone's level of experience or baking opinions are not worth getting upset about.\n+ Please keep all discussions related to baking. No party invites or spam.\n+ Be supportive to bakers who may not be on the same level as you are.\n+ If using links or posting images, stay appropriate.\n\n### Feel free to post pictures of your latest bake, links to recipes, or any other resources.\n\n### How to share images: \n\nTo share images, you have to have posted it somewhere online whether that be Instagram, Pinterest, Imgur, Flickr, etc. \n\nTo post your image directly into chat, you can do: ! [your link to the image] (your link to the image, again)\n\nImages posted directly in chat tend to be really big and can be hard to see, so you may prefer to use the method below.\n\nIf you'd like to just post a link to your image in chat, you can do: [here is my image!] (your link to the image)\n\nWhen filling in the information, make sure you don't include any spaces between the brackets and the parenthesis. Also, when linking your image, make sure you are linking a website it has been posted to. I've also found linking it from google photos won't work because of sharing restrictions. \n\n_If you have any feedback or challenge ideas, I'd love to hear it. This guild is oriented to what *you* want!_\n\n**Thank you to those who have contributed to the guild:**\n@SevastraTheJester\n@Lokkanet\n@CernyPie\n@Wangenh_\n@Nakonana",

      "description":"Hi there!!! This is my first time making a guild, but I thought I'd give it a shot. I often find it difficult to get myself motivated to eat and make food because of depression and OCD. When I seek help online, I often come across \"easy recipes\" that either still takes too much effort or have ingredients that I don't have access to. So, I hoped that those impacted and who know the struggle can share some recipes that have helped them and label them according to how hard they are in terms of motivation. I found one article that was actually able to help me when it came to food that used a system that I found really helpful, here is the link:\n\nhttps://lifehacker.com/how-to-feed-yourself-when-youre-really-depressed-1823560127\n\nThere, they use a system of labeling the difficulty as \"Level 0: Easier than showering, Level 1: About as easy as showering, and Level 2: Harder than showering.\" I found something like that really helpful because it takes into account the motivation issue and it was quite helpful. We can come up with other names if we'd like!\n\nThe point is to try and make a space where we share helpful eating tips and recipes so that others who know the struggle can hopefully come together and help each other out! Hope that all makes sense! Go ahead and join if you'd find this helpful!!",

      "description":"# :pushpin: Notice board\n\nThe previous guild leader, catliyon, has stepped down early (originally planning to leave Sept 2023). Apologies to all for the change in plans, and thank you all for your support and participation!\n\n**Never-ending challenge**\n- :dizzy: [Stressed Yet Active](https://habitica.com/challenges/ecd65830-6dee-423d-a572-22cc9b9ef298): Feeling overwhelmed? Join this challenge to help remind yourself to continue to prioritize your health.   \n\n# :european_post_office: Guild overview      \n\n## ♣ Psst! Hey, you!\n\n*You look like a likely friend in these shady parts...* If you come down this alley... and around this corner... and knock on this door eight times (like this)... you can get into the Rogues' Playground. We hang out here to trade tips, challenge each other to practice our exercises, brag about our accomplishments, and plan excursions to ah... lift some gems from those who are otherwise overburdened with them, you know?\n\n## ♠ To Be A Rogue \n\nRole-play is welcome! It's assumed that any mention of rogue-ish behavior is purely for guild story-telling purposes. It doesn't matter if your class on Habitica is actually a rogue or not--you're an honorary rogue while you're here! \n\nWe're a pretty welcoming lot. If you have any questions, concerns, or just something you'd like to discuss, pull up a chair and let us know what's on your mind! (But do keep an eye on your purse.)\n\n## ♦ Challenges\n\n### Weekly challenges    \n- **PACs**: each week from Monday to Sunday; set your own goals. At the end of the week, you can post to the guild about your accomplishments (a \"brag\"). If you don't meet your expectations, that's OK! We invite you to think about how you want to adapt the next PAC to suit you better.\n\n### Unexpected challenges\nRarely, an unexpected challenge shows up, often with no notice and a very soon end date. Gotta keep everyone on their toes!   \n\n### Other challenges\nAll guild members are welcome to post physical fitness challenges as long as:\n1. Challenges have a gem prize\n2. Challenges run no longer than a month--this helps keep challenges fresh and open to new members   \n\n**Note:** The exception for the [:dizzy: Stressed Yet Active](https://habitica.com/challenges/ecd65830-6dee-423d-a572-22cc9b9ef298) challenge. If you have any ideas for never-ending challenges, please discuss with the guild leader before posting   ",

This is a spot to share them. \"There is no need to be perfect to inspire others, let people be inspired by how you deal with imperfections.   \n~   \n\nCurrent challenge: Habitica Perfect Day Celebration - February 2022\nIf this challenge is no longer running, then none at the moment, but feel free to start a guild related one if you want to! :wink:\n   \n~\n\n **Some quotes on perfection**\n\n- “Perfection is not attainable, but if we chase perfection we can catch excellence.” ~ Vince Lombardi \n- “The pursuit of perfection often impedes improvement.” ~ George Will \n- \"If all pork chops were perfect, we wouldn't have hot dogs.\" ~ from Steven Universe  ~ \n- “Success has nothing to do with perfection.” ~ Michelle Obama.\n\n- \"Perfect is the most boring thing you can be, so go ahead and mess up big!” ~ Felicia Day.\n\n- \"The aim of life is self-development. To realize one's nature perfectly, - that is what each of us is here for. People are afraid of themselves, nowadays. They have forgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to one's self.\" ~ Oscar Wilde.\n\n- \"There would be no need for love if perfection were possible. Love arises from our imperfection, from our being different and always in need of the forgiveness, encouragement and that missing half of ourselves that we are searching for, as the Greek myth tells us, in order to complete ourselves.\" ~ Eugene Kennedy\n\n- \"Details make perfection, and perfection is not a detail.\" ~ Leonardo Da Vinci\n\n- \"If I waited for perfection...I would never write a word.” ~ Margaret Atwood.\n\n - \"Pleasure in the job, puts perfection in the work\" ~ Aristotle\n\n\n\n- “Perfection is attained by slow degrees; it requires the hand of time.” ~ Voltaire\n- **Get your quote here, share it in Guild chat.**\n\n~\n\n **Thoughts by guild members that deserve to be quoted.**\n- Don't set yourself up to fall, know that you can fly. ~ J RIOTT\n\n\n~  \n\n\"Perfect Day is sometimes Perfectly Silent.  Pop in, say hi and change that! \n(Chances are we are either tasking or suffering from Perfection Paralysis, a frustrating condition where a drive for perfection keeps the first note unplayed, the first line undrawn, and the first word untyped. Inspiration is usually welcome!)\n\n~",

At the same time, I hope that members will try to adhere fairly closely to the original AA principals when contradictions arise.\n\nThere are no experts in this group, please seek medical, psychiatric, or legal help if you are in an addiction related crisis.

These aren't just any important goals, these are long-standing life goals, that don't have a sense of urgency behind them.   Yep, that's right, no boss, no pressure, no deadline...other than I know I want to achieve these goals for a happy satisfied life. \n   These are the tasks that sing, \"My life would be better if...\" and often have a series of boring small tasks leading up to the final important outcome.  \n   With weekly challenge goals as a priority, these important someday-if's, can get done because I'm choosing to create and live my best life. \n\nOngoing challenges in this guild: \n- Weekly Goal Groupies [Go Farther Together](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fAwLFpphhk-e2CWh5jQKN2OAf20DcT506Gyxvg--33w/edit?usp=sharing)  \n- Guild members are welcome to create group challenges that inspire them! \n- Gem donations are welcome and appreciated.\n\n**'Go Farther Together'** Put your habitica name and weekly goal in the group [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fAwLFpphhk-e2CWh5jQKN2OAf20DcT506Gyxvg--33w/edit?usp=sharing) If we beat that week's army, a gem winner is chosen (regardless of whether you beat your personal goal). If we beat four armies in a row, an extra gem winner is chosen (2nd gem winner).  Finally, if our average for the year is beating the foe's average for the year, than another gem winner is chosen.\n\n:trophy: Challenge winners \n- week 17, apr 24 - 30           @beata_maria 6th\n- week 18, may 1 - 7              @Ellistea57, Begonia Skullsworth @RFT (3rd), @Tuvshinzaya (2nd)\n- week 19, may 8 - 14            @nfar (3rd)\n- week 20, may 15 - 21          @pnisheep_2323 (2nd), @Luckyducky1423 (4th), @booklover89 (4th)\n\n\n**Monthly Goal Completion**  Work towards your goals (1-3 recommended) each week.

      "description":"**`Definition by Johann von Wovern from 1603:`**\n> \"[A Person having] knowledge of various matters, drawn from all kinds of studies [...] ranging freely through all the fields of the disciplines, as far as the human mind, with unwearied industry, is able to pursue them.\"\n\nA historical figure that comes to mind would be `Leonardo da Vinci`. While becoming famous for his paintings, most importantly the Mona Lisa, he was also active as an ***engineer, scientist, theorist and architect***. With all these qualities he fit perfectly into the Renaissance. Although later named that way this time span is known for the open-mindedness and emergence of lost knowledge. In this time it was a virtue for some men to become knowledgeable in all possible fields.\n\n___ \n\n\n\n Today the world is more complex and knowing everything in one field alone is impossible. However this shouldn't discourage us. Each one of us can acquire knowledge in more than one field. Thus we follow our heroes and start learning in multiple fields.\n\n\n\n We believe that successfully acquiring knowledge in more than one field is beneficial. It will help us see the world around us from a different perspective.\n\n> ##  We believe that every person has the power to gain knowledge and thus should be supported on their endeavour.\nWe believe that all humans are equally able to become a polymath. Thus it's important to support everyone regardless of personal features or background.\n\n`Join us on our adventure to learn more about the world and ourselves!`\n\n\n---\n## Guild rules\n1.    Don’t advertise other guilds or recruit for your party here. There are separate guilds for these purposes.\n2.    Be friendly to each other. The habitica [Community Guidelines](https://habitica.com/static/community-guidelines) are strict to keep a friendly atmosphere.\n3.    If you want to create a challenge please talk to  the guild leader in advance to make sure that your idea fits the guild. Challenges can only last for a maximum of 6 months. \n\n---\nbio by @kanga\n\n___ \n## Challenge links! \nPlease note all challenges are currently perpetual, with no gems to be won. We encourage you to leave monthly reviews to keep accountability of your goals and progress :) \n\n### Reading Challenges\n+ [Fiction book](https://habitica.com/challenges/5d0d72f0-feb0-46ce-be2c-5656a71fe1e0)\n+ [Non-Fiction](https://habitica.com/challenges/738b5438-0ed8-4b89-a4c3-3791646677de)\n\n\n### Declutter Challenges \n+ [Physical Decluttering](https://habitica.com/challenges/12885a4d-4caf-48e4-a971-e313ac5a5fda) \n+ [Digital Decluttering](https://habitica.com/challenges/8a89e9c8-bf33-4cc2-9375-79d164f60672)\n\n### Productivity/ Goals Challenges\n+ [Levelling up](https://habitica.com/challenges/caa3f1ee-89d8-47b6-8dc2-adb212476d18)\n+ [Self Care](https://habitica.com/challenges/4a12d9f6-50d9-411e-8cc2-c754e9e0e25d)\n+ [Self Taught - Start a Course](https://habitica.com/challenges/ffdc9cab-cc4c-4be1-8da0-35ccb9709ecf)\n\n+ [12 week year planning only](https://habitica.com/challenges/f90ec286-4c86-456b-ac44-e7f36e785c8e)\n+ [12 week year](https://habitica.com/challenges/e4af7138-b0d3-4707-8a2c-fc9406c63bba)\n\n### Seasonal Bucket Lists Challenges \n + [Seasonal Bucket List Spring](https://habitica.com/challenges/27bf3f88-72fb-43ff-ae26-fe8272b1776f)   :seedling:\n+ [Seasonal Bucket List Summer](https://habitica.com/challenges/2ebe93a4-b292-4d46-94c6-0da5520c23b8) ☀\n+ [Seasonal Bucket List Autumn](https://habitica.com/challenges/89af645c-bd3f-48ce-b91d-105753fc0c72) 🍁\n+ [Seasonal Bucket List Winter](https://habitica.com/challenges/08211770-a0f7-4af8-9f61-7b6da130c734) ❄\n\n\n### Journalling Challenges\n+ [Art Journal](https://habitica.com/challenges/400fc75d-8c1b-4c00-9a6f-2e388f4f8acf)\n+ [Stoic Journal](https://habitica.com/challenges/ed7e1853-aef5-4b19-9634-42f0094777df) \n\n+ [Write A Novel](https://habitica.com/challenges/f3921758-c023-491b-a8bf-46263a08e1fc)\n",

Everything's great until something happens. \n- The cursed Writer's Block starts to rear his head, block your path and fog your mind\n- You can't figure out how to reword this one scene so that it sounds right\n- You can't figure out your character(s).

How do they act? etc.\n- You're new to blogging and you're not sure you're using the right platform\n- You're not sure if your blog... sounds right\n- Or maybe you just need encouragement to find the time to sit down and actually write.\n\nEvery writer has been there.

Markdown is very easy to learn, very popular, and very beneficial. \n\nTo insert links you need to enclose the text for the link in brackets and the URL in parentheses. For example: `[Check this out!](www.example.com)` will look like this [Check this out!](www.example.com) **Make sure there are no spaces between the brackets and the parentheses.**\n\nAnd refer back to the [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) if you forget how to do something. \n\nWhen you share your writing, please post a little description stating what it is about, and please specify if your writing contains anything that might be suggestive or dark for younger readers.\n\nLinks shared will be added here for ease of access. Please ping @Bravisha_Skietano if the link is changed or removed.\n\n## ✎﹏Works By The Community﹏\nFeel free to check these out in your free time.

As a Twitch-based streamer, Jebro has said many times that we are an inclusive, welcoming bunch of people and that includes people from all around the world, who play different games, with different struggles in their lives and some very different stories to tell. \n\nHabitica is all about getting things done, building good habits and sort of like dailies in games it's about making sure that the habits are rewarding as well.  But it's also about that sense of community, coming together to do things in a way that is rewarding.  So if you like the system here? Create some challenges. If it's to drink water daily, to remember to actually log into your games that you play and DO your fictional dailies, to walk around the block, to read for school, to meditate, to do a no spend month, whatever you need. Things will be in flux as we figure out the system but poke your regular discord mods (Reader, Ryelis, Gribble, Mazer, Jagtress) if you have questions. \n\nAnd we will be running quests on here regularly.

It's not a requirement, anyone can participate! :zap: But basically, this guild focuses on building tiny, sustainable habits every day. \n\n*Spirit of community is very important and dear to us. Welcome to the family!*\n\n## Core Beliefs and Practices\n\n* We prioritize strengthening a positive, healthy identity\n* We practice identity-based habits \n* We commit to systems, not to goals \n* We plan big but make our steps small on purpose \n* We focus on sustainability of habits\n* We are cautious of inevitable boredom\n\n## New to the Guild?\n\n**:question: I just joined, what now?** \n* Hello, welcome! We're happy to have you! \n* Make an introductory post, share your goals, your roadblocks and what currently works for you!\n\n**:question: I didn't read the book, can I still join?**\n* Of course! You can also read some excerpts at [James Clear's website](https://jamesclear.com) \n\n**:question: What are check-ins?** \n* Typically in the morning, we encourage you to set your focus for the day. Here, we do 3 gratitudes and 3 tasks to zap. You are encouraged to make your check-ins anything you want, however, if you're not meeting them every day, talk to us and let us help you! You are also able to make check ins multiple times in the day to stay accountable. \n\n## Onboarding \n\n:zap: _Decide the person you want to be, prove it to yourself with small wins._\n\n:zap: To make a habit sustainable: \n1. Make it **obvious**. Select a trigger/cue. \n2. Make it **attractive**. Inject joy into your habits. \n3. Make it **easy**. What can you do to minimize friction?\n4. Make it **satisfying**. [How do you reward yourself or celebrate? Coins? Fist in the air? Bragging rights?](http://www.wellthyboss.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/102-Tiny-Habit-Celebrations.jpg)\n\n## Quick Links \n* [Systems vs Goals](https://jamesclear.com/goals-systems)\n* [Habit Creep - How to Change Your Life](https://jamesclear.com/habit-creep)\n* [Repetitions - Put Your Reps In](https://jamesclear.com/repetitions)\n\n## FAQ & Glossary\n* **Why we practice gratitude?** Gratitude is one of those habits that will start to roll changes into the rest of your life. We focus on being healthy mentally here, practicing gratitude and kindness to self is a great way to prove that to yourself.\n* **Why the focus on tiny habits?** There are tons of guilds that focus on other habits, we want to focus on making small, manageable steps towards a larger purpose. This is why we encourage setting upper-bounds and 2-minute habits.\n",

It not only benefits yourself, but other creatures, the animals, and the environment, in a major way every single day without taking away anything from you. It's as simple as choosing not to have animals be killed for your meals and we have that choice three times a day 🌱\n\n",

You want to take your time building your challenge? You want to test something? You don't want to create a challenge alone, but together with others? You don't have the 4 gems necessary to create a private guild where you could do this? Or maybe you want everyone to be able to wander in and comment while the challenge is still under construction? You can do all this here! All the challenges in here are under construction or used for testing purposes. They are not meant for \"real\" participation.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- :put_litter_in_its_place: Please delete your challenges when you no longer need them here! A challenge can only be deleted by its creator and by Habitica admins. Let's hope we don't have to ask the admins to clean up abandoned, obsolete challenges here too often! (If an owner of a sandbox challenge hasn't logged into Habitica for 6 months or more, they will be sent a private message. If they don't respond to the message within a week, their challenge will be deleted.)\n\n- :dancers: When your challenge is ready to run, you can [clone](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Running_a_Challenge#Cloning_a_Challenge) it to the guild (or the Tavern or your Party) where you want it to run.\n\n- :file_folder: You can store a finished challenge template here for a while, too. But for permanent storage, please rather use one of the following places:\n    - The [:scroll: Library of Tasks and Challenges](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/adcd6903-e3c6-4c27-a0e9-21f2e7515cd6), where everyone can see the challenge and is allowed to use its ideas for their own challenges.\n    - Your own [private \"solo\" guild](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Guilds#Solo_Guilds), where only you can see the challenge. (If you stop using Habitica, the challenge will be lost to the public.)\n    - Another guild that fits the challenge's topic and doesn't mind storing challenge templates.\n\n- :scroll: For more information about challenges, please read these wiki pages:\n    - [Challenges](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Challenges)\n    - [Running a Challenge](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Running_a_Challenge)\n    - [Advanced Tips for Challenge Creators](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Advanced_Tips_for_Challenge_Creators)\n\n- :point_right: You might also want to visit the [Guild Leaders & Challenge Creators](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/0393624e-65f0-40c1-8e87-360955fcebca) guild (and look at their long link list).\n\n- :beetle: There are usually a few challenge bugs. You can find documentation about them by looking for [issues tagged with the **\"section: Challenges\"** label in GitHub](https://github.com/HabitRPG/habitica/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22section%3A+Challenges%22).\n\n- :speech_balloon: Using the guild chat for test-formatting complicated chat posts is ok if it happens rarely. But better (less spammy) test methods are: Sending messages to yourself, or using your own private one-person guild or one-person party, or using the text of a task, or even using a challenge description. If you test chat post formatting here nonetheless (maybe for a final check after already having used one of the other methods), please:\n    - Mark test posts as experimental: Add something like \"I just want to check how this post looks and if I got the formatting right!\" either to the post itself or to the one before or after.\n    - Delete test posts after you no longer need them. During your test, there shouldn't be more than 3 of your test posts in the chat at the same time. After your test, there should be none (except if they contain rare and complicated formatting that might interest others).\n\n- :pencil: The guild is already mentioned in a section of the wiki page [Running a Challenge](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Running_a_Challenge#Challenge_Sandbox). If, in addition to that, anyone wants to create a wiki guild page for this guild, feel free! (I won't have time for it any time soon.) \n\n---\n\n[Search terms](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Guild_Creation_and_Maintenance_Tips#Search_Terms) (to make it easier to find this guild): \n\n*challenge creation, challenge building, challenge testing, test challenge, challenge construction, challenge under construction, challenge cooperation, challenge teamwork, challenge proofreading, challenge workshop, complicated challenge, ...*\n\n(Please suggest more in chat if you can think of any!)",

      "description":"The guild where everyone posts in haiku! \n********\nWrite about your day  \nin the form of a haiku  \nand post to the guild\n********\nHaiku is, today, a 17-syllable verse form consisting of three lines of 5, 7, and 5 syllables. Some people like to stick strictly to the 5, 7, 5 pattern, others like to regard this as more of a guideline. However, though lines can be shorter and still make a good haiku, lines should never be longer than 5, 7, 5 syllables.\n*****\n[More information on haiku, along with some examples, can be found here](http://www.shadowpoetry.com/resources/haiku/haiku.html).\n******\n**NB: In order to format your haiku neatly, press the Spacebar twice before pressing Enter to move down to start a new line.** Pressing the Enter key twice at the end of each line works in Firefox, but results in an ugly blank line if viewed in Chrome!  \n****  \n**How I choose the winner of the Haiku and Senryu challenges**  \n  \nThis question has come up a couple of times and as it's not easy to explain something complicated via the medium of a haiku, I thought I'd add it to the guild information.  \n  \n**Short version**  \n  \nRandomness plays a large part, but skill counts too.\n\n**The full explanation**  \n  \nHow does that work? First I generate a list of random numbers based on how many people joined the challenge. Let's say the first random number was 3. I look at the third name on the list of participants.  \n  \nIf Participant #3 has fulfilled all the requirements of the challenge (write a haiku or senryu and add it to the notes on the To-Do) and also posted it to the guild, they will be the winner.  \n  \nIf Participant #3 *hasn't* done all the tasks, I look at the next random number in the list. And so on until I find a winner.\n  \nSo why did I mention skill? If I look at the haiku and I don't think it's quite good enough to win or perhaps it's a haiku in the senryu challenge or vice versa, then I'll look at the next random person. Also, if the randomly chosen participant won the challenge last month, I will move on to look at the other entrants **UNLESS** the haiku/senru is *really really* good.  \n  \nSo please post as many haikus and senryus to the guild as you want, but pick your best one for the month's challenge and post **just one** into the notes on the To-Do.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n![haiku](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/669/23397661495_960441b6e2_o.jpg)",

Mindfulness can seem unrelated to emotional mastery at first, but in reality it is the skill set that allows all the other skills to work.

They are Emotion Regulation, Distress Tolerance, and Interpersonal Effectiveness.\n\nI have used and can recommend [this workbook](https://www.amazon.com/Dialectical-Behavior-Therapy-Skills-Workbook/dp/1572245131).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTwo important notes: \n1) Habitica is NOT the right place to go for medical advice. If you have (or suspect you may have) a mental health or other medical condition, talk to a professional before deciding whether the ideas you find online are right for you.\n2) This guild discusses sensitive topics which may include depression and self-harm.\n\n![Guild Logo](http://www.michael-gordon.com/images/large/_MG_8504.jpg)",

Is it strength? Intelligence? Discipline? Focus? Learning several languages or a new skill? Winning a world record? Conquering your biggest fear?  \nIf you have willpower, you can reach all the above. Actually, with willpower alone, you can surpass other superpowers: you don't have to worry about focus nor discipline, intelligence becomes irrelevant, and it can greatly improve your strength. And, as you might guessed, willpower makes learning anything easier and is the secret to any great achievement, including world records. Plus, fear itself is very afraid of willpower.  \n\"Willpower\" is a very simple word, but very hard to really understand.  \nThis word and concept is largely used when trying to change habits and improving ourselves, though is actually one of the less understood productivity strategies that I ever found.  \nThis guild was created to change that! I'll make my best efforts to demystify the greatest power of all!  \n**Hidden tip**: using Habitica everyday naturally improves and develops your Willpower muscle.  \n___\n_\"That's easy, all it takes is willpower!\"_: person who doesn't understand how willpower works.  \n___\nSynonyms: determination, strength of will, strength of character, firmness of purpose, fixity of purpose, resolution, resolve, resoluteness, purposefulness, single-mindedness, drive, commitment, dedication, doggedness, tenacity, tenaciousness, staying power; stickability; (informal) stick-to-it-iveness; perseveration  \n self-discipline, self-restraint, restraint, self-control, self-mastery, self-possession, will power, strength of will, composure, coolness; moderation, temperateness, temperance, abstemiousness, abstention, non-indulgence.\n___\n**Recommended books:**  \n\"The Power Of Habit\", by  Charles Duhigg  \n\"The Willpower Instinct\", by Kelly McGonigal  \n\"Willpower : Rediscovering the Greatest Human Strength\", by Roy F Baumeister and John Tierney  \nI strongly advise you to read those books, even if you don't want to join our challenges nor chat in the guild but need to learn about willpower.  \nOther sources (that I haven't study yet) will be added later.\n___\n**:gem: donors:** (2 used in  total)  \n- 4 gems - @BardoVelho  \n- 5 gems - @Alys  \n- 2 gems - @aspiring_advocate\n- 1 gem   - @kiramac  \n- 5 gems - @Monroe333  \n\nNOTE: To be a **Gem Donor**, all you have to do is gift the gems you wish to the leader @BardoVelho **specifying that those are for the Willpower Instinct Guild** (or else I might not notice that I have receive them), and then I'll note that in the Guild description, plus the ones used. As default, every new periodic challenge will have one gem (if you wish your gems to be used in a different way, please specify it in the Personal Message that you sent to me), and the **gem donor** will be stated as the **Gem Sponsor** in the **Challenge Information** section of the respective challenge description. If you wish to be an anonymous donor, please let me know upfront.  \n*Thank you all for donating gems to this guild, this really increases my willpower to make more and quality challenges, as they do take several hours to make and a lot of brain energy.*  \n___\nCreated: 29/05/2019",

      "description":"**Welcome Everyone!**  \nHow do you complete a journey of 10,000 miles?  One step at a time. \n\n**Tools We Use:** \n\n***Challenges and Synchronized Pomodoros***\n\n**1) 🎯 Weekly 10 Hours A Week Challenge and additional Challenges Created by Guild Members**  \nAnyone can start a challenge if you think of something that will help us get through our project. Scroll down to **Challenges** to check out the helpful challenges created by guild members!**\n\n**2) Synchronized :tomato:s**  \nWe also do :tomato: together.  aka **Synchronized Pomodoros (aka synch :tomato:)**  Anyone can start or join a :tomato:.  To synch with different time zones, we indicate the start with the number of minutes after the hour.  \n:30 means a :tomato: will start 30-minutes after the hour.  So if you're in San Francisco, the :30 pom would start at 2:30pm for you, and 11:30 pm for someone in Rome and 9:30 am for someone in Auckland.  \n\nThere are three ways to participate in a synchronized pomodoro.  \n\n**1. Join the [LTP Synchronized Pomodoro Room Cuckoo](https://cuckoo.team/Long.Term.Project.Guild)**  A synchronized Pomodoro room.  \n**2. Get the [Forest app](https://www.forestapp.cc) and create a group by PMing invitations.  Then you can invite people who are working to plant with you.**  \n**3. Synchronized Pomodoro in the LTP Guild Chat.  Here's a Step-by-Step Guide**   \n\nIn our guild, anyone can start a synchronized :tomato:.  \nA pomodoro, or pom :tomato:, is a unit of time that alternates 25-minutes of focused work with a five-minute break.   To learn more about the [Pomodoro Technique](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique) check out Francesco Cirillo's website. (He invented it!).  \n\n**Step 1:** Check the chat to see if anyone has already started a synch :tomato:, in which case you can join in.  \n**Step 2:** To start a synch :tomato: express the time you will be starting by indicating the number of minutes after the hour.  That way people from different time zones can synch with you.  So if you're starting at noon your time, you would write \":00\" in the chat.  \n**Step 3:** Write what you intend to work on in the chat along with the start time, and invite anyone who wants to work at the same time to join in.   \nIf you're joining a synch :tomato:  write a message to the person starting it and say that you’re joining them.  Write what you are going to work on during the :tomato:.  \n**Step 4:** Start working, and keep working for 25-minutes.  \n**Step 5:** During the 5-minute break, go back to the chat and report how your work went, and read other people's report.  If you decide to do another one, repeat starting with **Step 2**.  \n\nThat's it!

Dumont The Power of Concentration\n___\n\n#### USEFUL POSTS\n\n+ Temide (pretty harsh but sometimes it's just what we need): I'm hearing that 20 min per day of the goal slide is to much time? You can get mad at me, but are you friking kidding me? You refuse to work on your own energy levels and the way you feel everyday for 20 min but you think your reality will change? By what means? Transurfing is not about wishing and waiting for it to happen (for that you can read \"The Secret\") it's about having the Intention, being patient with the coming change, believing in the coming change and ACTING. What transurfing states is that to guilt, procrastination, fear the antidotes are ACTION. So this goal slide is your work! This is what changes your reality - you. You change how you feel and what you attract and you change your reality. And then your world get's you your toy!\nI feel that most are confused with the goal slide. It is not a hard and tedious task. You should consult the Transurfing books for actual \"original\" description but I will explain how I understand it. So you said it's like dreaming. YES! And that's the point. You put yourself into that dream (you do not need to know how you will get there, it is trivial) and you live in that dream for 20 min. during the day. Why? Because you then switch to the mood and state of mind of a person who has achieved it, and so you attract it. The 20 min. I didn't come up myself. that time limit was in the books. When to get those 20 min per day? Do you walk to work/ bus/ train? Do you have lunch breaks (alone)? Do you shower? Do you cook? Do you go jogging? Just go to the goal slide every chance that you have, even if it's for a minute. Aggregated thought the day it will for sure be more than 20 min. You mean to tell me that you can not find 20 min of time trough your day to celebrate your life that you want, that you are working for?\n+ Yₐₘᵢ₋Dₐₒₕ, Aᵣₜₑₛãₒ dₒ Cₐₒₛ: If you don't know what should be your first step, I believe you should not worry about it and you should focus on your slides. I can't say for sure, but reading the books I came to believe that when you got the determination to have (Which I believe its something like being sure you will have it sooner or later - and this must be an unshakable certainty), external intention will automatically transfer you to the corresponding lifetrack and when that happen a door will open before you... Your job is to notice those opening doors. In any case, you should be sure that this is YOUR goal, and not someone else... There is an entire chapter about how to find your goals. And also you should remember to keep importance at minimum, meaning that if you can not have it right now, it doesn't matter. It's yours, you will have it anyway.\n\n",

      "description":"\"In our quest to learn, we often face a clash between what we believe and what is true. We tend to accept only the ideas that fit our existing beliefs, avoiding anything that challenges us.\n\nBut inside every physics student, there's a desire for knowledge that pushes us to explore beyond our comfort zones. With time, we uncover the mysteries and discover undeniable truths in theoretical physics.\n\nYet, accepting these truths can be challenging. It shakes our understanding and makes us question what we thought we knew. To grow, we must embrace the facts and face the uncomfortable realities that expand our knowledge.\n\nOur personal biases limit our understanding. We must break free from these limitations and let curiosity guide us deeper into the world of physics. By challenging our biases, we open doors to new insights and discoveries, bringing us closer to a profound understanding of the universe.\n\nSo, let's question what we think we know and embrace the power of hard facts in our pursuit of physics knowledge. Together, we can overcome biases, explore new frontiers, and uncover the mysteries of the cosmos.\"\n\n*Existential suffering; derailing the urge of seeking purpose and customizing purpose according to ones liking \n\n*Mindfulness ; level up awareness and optimize identity\n\n* Atomic habits; a framework to forge oneself \n\n* Psychodynamic psychotherapy ; disarming defense mechanism that hinder productivity\n\n* ryder carrol's bullet journal : busy vs productive \n\n*\n\n*\n\n\n\nHere, we emphasize the power of listening, for it brings solace to others, showing them that they are heard and valued. Mindfulness guides our every word, fostering sincerity and genuine connections.\n\nFear not to ask any questions related to physics, mindfulness, bipolar disorder, psychodynamic psychotherapy, self-hypnosis, atomic habits, Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance, Plum Village, and more. We believe in the continuous growth of each member, acknowledging that expertise varies among us.\n\nLanguage holds no bars of doubt here; express yourself freely, without worry of being right or wrong. Share your thoughts on these topics to enhance our collective awareness. Let us create an open sandbox environment, where ChatGPT assists in streamlining discussions and simplifying tasks.\n\nCraft your own dailies, habits, and todos tailored to your needs. Engage in conversations with fellow Titans, for fruitful exchanges enrich the crafting of our daily routines. Together, we shape a supportive and inspiring community.\n\nJoin Theoretical Titans and embark on this extraordinary journey of intellectual growth and self-discovery. Let's embrace the sandbox experience, utilizing the power of ChatGPT and collective wisdom to elevate our understanding.\n\nTogether, we ascend as Titans of knowledge and forge a path towards greatness.\n\nWelcome to Theoretical Titans, where brilliance, growth, and connection thrive.\n\n\n",

These challenges can have gem prizes or no gem prizes. There will be an official challenge each month created by the guild leader @avataranimal\n\n💎Post ideas for challenge in the guild. I may give a gem reward for novel ideas if I use them for a challenge (when the challenge starts). Be warned, if I have already had the same idea and it's on my list of upcoming challenges, I probably won't award gems. I will give a 5 gem reward (plus supplying the prize gems) if you volunteer to run a challenge for me (set it up with all the to-dos and habits, answer any questions in the guild). You can also develop ideas in the chat, and test interest.💎  \n\nIdeally, challenges should:\n - be fairly general  \n - include the 👤 symbol\n - include a to-do reporting back to the guild   \n - include a closing date and method of choosing the winner  \n - you CAN win your own challenge if it is fair - ie if you choose the winner using a [random number generator](https://www.random.org/) from participants who have completed certain tasks.  \n\nThank you to Midnight, the original owner and creator of this guild. And thank you to Maikri, who took over the guild after midnight and gave ownership of it to [@AvatarAnimal](https://habitica.com/profile/e958bcdc-4f03-46d3-b4b9-67175f8e2e59), who has since passed it on to Faranae.

But even after removal, they are always welcome to join back once they are active again :)  \nIf you ever find yourself falling out of Habitica or find the activity level of this guild too overwhelming:\n\n1. You can create a Fandom Wiki account and [follow](https://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/5dfa77963d47893b8474869d/5e2f0ff43a4fba2200724b60/85213275e1db31705fa109f62d3160e6/grafik.png) the guild page. This way you'll receive emails when the page is edited (which happens every ~2 days) and you can see all the tips without having to read the chat. \n\n2. You can get rid of constant notifications by leaving the guild and creating a Daily with its title being a hyperlink to the guild. For the hyperlink, write: `[ADHDers Guild 🐿](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/17848f38-0418-4764-9fe8-91fdc9950e32)`. You'll still be able to access the chat and challenges even without being a member. \n\n3. You can \"disable\" the notifications icon on the website by creating a \"userstyle\" for yourself (it's surprisingly easy, and you can easily have the icon back by clicking the [Stylus Icon and unchecking the Habitica box](https://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/5dfa77963d47893b8474869d/5e2f0ff43a4fba2200724b60/a30ce9873c9c714ea9bbba72560afe8f/grafik.png) xD). Download [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus#releases) for your browser. Open it by clicking the icon in your browser and choose to add a new style.

      "description":"Hear ye, hear ye! Check this guild for proclamations of which beast is terrorising Habitica today! Post here to report on your battles toward the end of the challenge, or to make suggestions, comments or ask questions.\n\nAugust challenge [here](https://habitica.com/challenges/67d02da3-2182-4176-8093-08f757039347)\n\nlink to modification ideas [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ora127O05pFdZ7n5l6HZfHbZGfBT8Ab-5PT3gbqkq6w/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nChallenge description:\n\nAn evil demon is cursing the beasts of Habitica! Every day a new beast (chosen randomly) is possessed by the demon and turns into a ferocious, demonic killing machine with supernatural strength, cunning and evil magic. The only way to drive out the demon is with the help of your pet or mount of the identical type. This loyal, noble version of the beast has the power to fight and defeat its evil doppelganger. If you don’t have this beast in your stables, try to maximise your drops with positive habits, dailies and to dos, in order to find the egg, potion or food you need to grow the pet or mount. That way the challenge gives you extra motivation as well as fun! You only compete with yourself (in the true spirit of Habitica) and you can tailor the challenge to your needs and preferences. To find the right level of difficulty for you, try the ideas suggested by the challenge or our amazing guild community -see ideas [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ora127O05pFdZ7n5l6HZfHbZGfBT8Ab-5PT3gbqkq6w/edit?usp=sharing) or create your own!\n\nIf you find the noble version of the beast, you will kill the demonic beast, striking a hit against the demon (click the positive habit). If you can’t enlist the help of a noble beast by the end of the day, the demonic one will turn on you and hurt you (click the negative habit). How much it hurts you depends on the fighting style you choose. \n\nNotes: *1. Clicking the negative habit does not cause damage to party members during quests -only missed dailies cause damage.* 2. if you have already grown your pet into a mount, you do not have the pet unless you rehatch it again.\n\n\nFor those who have released their stables or don't have many accumulated pets or items, @Thoughtdiva has made a bulk purchase of Mini-Mount Spray from the Wandering Wizard. She will give it away free to whoever feels they need it. If you spray it on a pet, it turns into a Mini Mount so it can battle a mount of the same type. If anyone wants the spray but not constant access to it, choose a daily or other goal that you don't achieve every day. Only when you achieve the goal or daily can you use the Mini Mount spray.\nEven more good news for Beast Battlers: A beatific angel also blesses special beasts in Habitica which turns them into Angelic Beasts to help us battle the demon! Each day, the angel calls (in a Heavenly voice) for you to bring her a particular type of beast. With her blessing, the Angelic Beast uses its supernatural powers to strike an extra blow against the demon! The angel may call for a Premium/ magic potion beast, a Quest beast or a Special/ Rare beast (no colour). NOTE: Only the 9 standard (“first generation”) pets in the 10 colours can become demonic and cause you damage (i.e. make you click negative on the Battle of the Beasts habit). Using Angelic Beasts is optional (although the angel may be disappointed if you withhold them from her!) and can only help you (allow you to click positive on the habit), not damage you.\nThis challenge ends at the Cron at the end of the month (7 am UTC 1st date of the next month) with plans to renew every month. \n\nFor those who are interested in the history of the Oracle, @Thoughtdiva was Oracle for a couple of years, then @CassandraWeatherwax, then @Ophal, with others helping out in between, especially @Bartimaeus, who is Oracle-in-second. Here is the story of the succession from one Oracle to another: \n\n*Cassandra drapes a silken cloth over the crystal ball. She removes the water from the quartz basin, which amplified the images, and turns it around. She looks around the small circular cave. The last reading. Time to move on. She gets up, throws a cloak around her shoulders and pulls the hood over her head. She steps out onto the mountain side and breathes in the cool, sweet scent. She lays her hand on the stone at the side of the cave, and the opening seals itself. \"Fare thee well, o brave fighters. And please welcome my successor(s) warmly!\" She walks down a meandering path.*\n\n*Ophal looks up from the country road she's been walking on for days now. In the distance she can finally make out her destination: the lone mountain where prophecies are made. She takes a look at the sun. \"I don't have much more time, I need to hurry,\" she murmurs. It's been weeks since she dreamed of that place for the first time. She knows that a great danger threatens the land of Habitica and her visions can help overcome it. With a resolute expression, she resumes her walk.*\nThanks @Cassandra_Weatherwax for all your hard work! I hope I can be as worthy :)\n\n",

      "description":".\nLove plant food? Concerned about your health and animal welfare? Think chickens are too cute to eat? So do we!\n\nThis guild is for all you on a veggie diet or those striving to be. Share your recipes, brag about that lovely barbecue dinner you hosted without ribs and steak, or perhaps a Raw version in a dehydrator. Discuss nutrition and find out about alternatives in the largest Veg Guild in Habitica!.\n\nAs a little note, if you're talking about specific products, do state the country you live in - for example the UK/EU and US market are vastly different!\n\nIf you're unsure about the difference between Vegetarians, Vegans and Raw Vegans, they can be viewed in stages:\n\n1. Vegetarian: A lifestyle choice without the consumption of animal meat. Many start their conscious journey as Vegetarians as many stores and restaurants offer Vegetarian options and labels including meat substitutes like Soya/Tofu, Quorn and Jack Fruit. Many spiritual paths around the world, both ancient and modern often recommend a minimum Vegetarian lifestyle for various reasons. \n\n2. Vegan: A lifestyle choice without the consumption of any animal derived products. The next stage of the conscious journey. Many choose to skip Vegetarian and go straight to a Vegan or Plant-Based lifestyle to help animals and the planet. The exclusion of dairy products have also become more popular recently in health and Self Care circles. Many famous entertainers have helped popularize the Vegan lifestyle.\n\n [Click Here for a list of Vegan Entertainers](https://www.livekindly.co/vegan-celebrities/)\n\n3. Raw Vegan: A lifestyle choice that is similar to Vegan but is not heated consistently over 42c/107F to preserve digestive enzymes for more energy, anti-aging effects through anti-oxidants and to combat or prevent other health related issues. A Raw Vegan lifestyle consists primarily of uncooked fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds. Through the use of a food dehydrator, creating raw versions of everyday dishes like pizza, sandwiches and burritos that taste similar or identical to their cooked or grain based counterparts can be fun and easy. Many entertainers in Hollywood have opted for a Raw Vegan lifestyle because of things like 20 hour work days and a need for higher mental focus. \n\n[Click here for the Raw Vegan woman who defied aging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6oJA_xhTa8)\n\nChoosing to live a conscious life is easy, whether you take baby steps or go full (plant-based) cold turkey. Let's work together to live a more conscious life and make the world a better place to live for all. And don't forget to ask questions! ",

Current leader is @Joey_de_Arpeggio (they/them/theirs). They are a Chinese queer ace enby and a long-time Habitican.**\n\nPrevious leaders: @jay1189 & @shanaqui\n\nBefore you ask: if you consider yourself to be queer, then yes, this guild is for you. It doesn't matter if you're gay, pan, ace, aro, demi, trans, genderfluid, agender or any of the other identities that fall under the queer umbrella. It doesn't matter who you are - Asian (whichever version :laughing:), Black, Brown or White. And you don't have to explain yourself to the guild. This can be a place for light-hearted banter, serious discussion of political topics, and anything in between. There are discussion challenges available to stimulate discussion around queer topics if you don't know what to post -- just join them and then participate when the right day rolls round! You should also feel free to start up or suggest your own challenges, chat generally with other users, ask for advice or share news.\n\nIf you see anything in the guild chat which makes you uncomfortable, please do flag it for the staffs' attention. Unfortunately I am NOT a mod, unlike @shanaqui :broken_heart:, so I will not be able to deal with issues internally.\n\nWarning: there may at times be references to adult topics as relate to trans* body issues. If you think anything you're going to post is likely to be triggering, please warn for it! Politics may also arise, obviously around LGBTQIA issues. Religion may also be discussed, as many queer people have a complex relationship with religion.\n\n---\n\nOnline resources:\n- [Asexuality Visibility & Education Network](https://www.asexuality.org/)\n- [Queering the Map](https://www.queeringthemap.com/) - Queer stories placed all over the world, down to streets and places\n- [Everywhere is Queer](https://www.everywhereisqueer.com/map) - global Queer businesses\n- [QueerLapis](https://www.queerlapis.com/)  - Malaysian-focussed community website\n\nPodcasts (both educational and entertainment, mostly stuff that I've come across previously):\n- [LGBTQIA+ wiki](https://lgbtqia.fandom.com/wiki/LGBTQIA%2B_Wiki)\n- [History is Gay](https://open.spotify.com/show/5OJ2KT4dt8lmLnXRpR1WGj?si=a0d52b5195414a6c)\n- [Gender Reveal](https://open.spotify.com/show/2yeW5Hk3qouVagY0f52zHG?si=a5ddfce8a5974090)\n- [Queer as Fact](https://open.spotify.com/show/3IX44zHEv58NmYK8RtnfDu?si=d26bcd1dc2254c92)\n- [Queer Movie Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/0CCv8Am34nmoetV5svlGEp?si=baf44b4eb865478c)\n- [Outward](https://open.spotify.com/show/72e0xzkDWilSlqBh95MwHV?si=38c60d176f2e4416) (Slate's LGBTQ podcast)\n- [QueerAF](https://open.spotify.com/show/3wiN3JZBJ2uqcg3R0OQDqP?si=fdb830a38875499e)\n- [A-OK](https://open.spotify.com/show/3OnREyuq086kqb7IBfVuzh?si=0a11e2eaa114442d) - interviews with people on the ace and aro spectrums\n- [Queer Not Here](https://open.spotify.com/show/2Lw0uhu9hv2n8GlcVoDcF3?si=d62a7517f42d4f31) - a podcast about the experience of queer folks who emigrated from Malaysia\n- [Kunyit Squared](https://open.spotify.com/show/4MxN7es3lvvlFTPTayIZee?si=09447d22346e45d0) - a podcast about the experience of queer folks _in_ Malaysia\n\nFor book recommendations, please join the [LGBTQ+ Books](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/7bb557fb-6639-425e-97d0-42b5024d8a06) guild",

      "description":"![JT](https://i.imgur.com/xlmLRDy.png)\n\nAs Jedi, we tune into The Force. We ask, where are we going as a humanity? Is all the chaos in the world waking us up to something greater? What is our greater potential as human beings and how do we reach it? or simply a return back to our true nature of mutually benefiting each other through cooperation? \n\nIt is said that our closest cousin, the Bonobo Apes are the least aggressive among our biological ancestors with a relatively flat and matriarchal hierarchy, so what happened that lead to the disharmonious world we live in today? Is it The Dark Side, the Sith? or something... else? \n\nAlthough Rey Skywalker took the last Jedi texts for herself (selfish much?), we have since adopted a new Jedi Training Manual in 9 simple scrolls: The Celestine Prophecy , which talks about the concepts of learning how to practically use and see The Force (Energy) and how humans struggle over it one way or another. By recognizing our unique ways of taking the limited energy from each other and begin tapping into the direct Unlimited energy of The Force, we begin to allow The Force to guide us to our true purpose in life.\n\nIn The Jedi Temple, we discuss how to use The Force, Mystical Experiences, we've had, and help each other along our journeys.\n\n### Your local library may have the new Jedi Scrolls (Celestine Prophecy books),\n[or Purchase on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Celestine-Prophecy-Adventure-James-Redfield/dp/0446671002)\n\n### There are also many free audio books read by volunteers and fans of the book:\n[Click for Free audio book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cYctPCVBCo)\n\n### Prefer to learn visually? Many of the concepts discussed in the temple can be watched in an interesting documentary titled [\"What the bleep Do We Know - Down the Rabbit Hole\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9tBE1ILP28)\n[Click here for Alternative Link](https://vimeo.com/196682882)\n\nFact: 390,127 people, almost 0.8 per cent of the population, listed their religion as Jedi on the 2001 Census as part of a protest against organised religion. The number fell to 176,632 in the 2011 Census, still making it the seventh-largest identified religion.

Stoicism is predominantly a philosophy of personal ethics which is informed by its system of logic and its views on the natural world. According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to happiness for humans is found in accepting this moment as it presents itself, by not allowing ourselves to be controlled by our desire for pleasure or our fear of pain, by using our minds to understand the world around us and to do our part in nature's plan, and by working together and treating others in a fair and just manner.\n\n# What is OpenStoic?\n\nThis Open Project will be offering a full set of information, pretending to offer a documentation center for all Stoicism related docs. Alongside, we will use Habitica as our training center for newcomers to this Philosophy. We would like to serve an Open Source distribution point and a readers opportunity to deepen in this philosophy.",

Also feel free to add ideas for challenges or feedback on the current challenges, as well as ideas on how to use this guild.*Many thanks to all who have helped contribute to this guild and challenge, especially @Sootica who set up the Secret Weapon google sheet!\n\n[August 2023 challenge](https://habitica.com/challenges/5dc372a5-2b1f-4439-a351-92ad86c1d42e)* Please join to be in the gem draw*\n\n[Googledocs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UuGv_ibIgefRmrOW9CVQifaxbMTHkAKLWUrxD8iO1-0/edit#gid=172190752)]\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/aG43cX3v\n\n\n\nChallenge description:\nThe Wicked Queen of Habitica is vain and lazy. She hates people who work hard on their goals and hates it even more when they look better than her! Every week she unleashes a different army to defeat the Allies in this challenge, but each challenge participant has a secret weapon - any piece of equipment or combination that you choose. This equipment is a powerful symbol of good looks and hard work which is like Kryptonite to the Wicked Queen's vanity and laziness. Decide on a goal every week (or just repeat it) and if you achieve your goal by midnight Sunday, Pacific Time, the daily will prompt you to mark \"yes\" on the google spreadsheet. (If you can't access the googlesheet, ask someone in the guild to report for you). With a certain proportion of secret weapons we will defeat the queen's army! \nClick here for the link to the Google sheet (or copy and paste if using the app). You can also download the free Googlesheets app to open the sheet straight from there whenever you want. Answer the simple yes/ no question each week (did you achieve your goal?). For each week you complete the doc, you get a chance at the gem prize.\nOptional: Show your secret weapon (equipment/ costume) in the Allies Guild for fun, group morale and accountability! See current challenge for fun variations that may apply.\n\n***If you don't report on time:***\n\nIf the sheet denies you access because you missed the deadline to report: You can mark your goal as achieved, if you wish, in the column where you write your goal - just not in the column that makes a difference to the calculations. That column is reserved for those who report on time, and that is how I calculate who wins the gem prize. If the RNG says number 87, a blank space means the person did not report on time and therefore I generate another random number. \n\nYou have to achieve and report on your goal by the end of the week, Sunday at midnight UTC (technically 12am Monday). There is actually a lot of leeway even then, as I do not announce the battle and close the sheet until at least 10 hours after that, to allow for a little more time for people to report. However, I'm always happy for people to suggest a better/ fairer time - it just needs to be consistent to be fair to everyone.\n \n**Nominate someone to get gems!**\nIf you spot someone who has been helpful in the guild, nominate them in the guild or PM to thoughtdiva and I will give them a gem!\n\n\n**Gem Hall of Fame**\n\n**Gem donations NO LONGER NEEDED**\nThanks to those who have kindly donated gems for the Secret Weapon challenge:\n\n@Sootica :snail: = 2 gems Nov, 2 gems Dec\n\n@Nedyfay = 5 gems Nov, 10 gems Jan, 1 gem July, 10 gems August! 25 gems Sept 2021!\n\nAnonymous = 5 gems Dec\n\n@Go2space = 1 gem June 2019\n\n@Felicius = 2 gems June\n\n@pineconejoy = 3 gems Sept, 2 gems Dec\n\n@Nyn/ LotusSword = 5 gems Sept, 25 gems Dec 21!\n\n@JuniperGrove = 5 gems Dec, 2 gems June 2020\n\n@Ryffy: 4 gems Jan 2020\n\n@Grouse: 1 gem Oct\n\n@mittern8sziffer: 5 gems Sept '21, 10 gems June '22\n\n@Bartimaeus 2 gems Jul '22\n\n@mittern8sziffer 158 gems!!! before they left Habitica :(\n\n**Total 162**\n\n",

Tek bildiğimiz bir şey vardı o da bu yolun engellerle dolu olduğu ve yolun sonunda kendimizi bulabileceğimiz. Uygulama ile hayatımızı oyuna çevirip daha eğlenceli bir şekilde sorumluluklarımızın üstesinden gelmeye başladık. Bu kendimizi geliştirmek ve önümüzdeki sınava eğlenceli bir şekilde çalışmak için bir fırsat verdi bize. \nBazen insanlar zorlukların üstesinden gelmek için motivasyon olarak sembol ararlar. Biz de hayatın zorluklarının farkındayız ve ***kurbağayı*** hayatımızdaki zorlukları aşmak için sembol olarak kullanmak istedik. Mısır'da ***kurbağa*** ***hayatın*** ve doğurganlığın sembolü ve Mısır mitolojisinde Heget doğurganlığı temsil eden ***kurbağa*** tanrıçasıdır. Bir sürü zorluklar olsa da hayatın bize o zorlukların ardından neler doğuracağını bilemiyoruz ama ikimiz de güzel şeyler olacağını umuyoruzz ^.^ \n\nSizler de bizimle bu yolculuğa çıkmak, bize eşlik etmek isterseniz kapımız daima açıkk.Sizleri yol arkadaşımız olarak yanımızda görmek bizi çok mutlu eder ^.^\n\nMe and @CelilE went on a journey as a couple.\nWhen we embarked on this journey, we were not yet sure of our goals and what we wanted. All we knew was that this road is full of obstacles and that we can find ourselves at the end of the road. With the application, we turned our lives into a game and started to overcome our responsibilities in a more fun way. This gave us an opportunity to improve ourselves and study for the next exam in a fun way.\nSometimes people look for symbols as motivation to overcome difficulties. We are also aware of the difficulties of life and we wanted to use the ***frog*** as a symbol to overcome the difficulties in our life. In Egypt, the ***frog*** is the symbol of ***life*** and fertility, and in Egyptian mythology, Heget is the ***frog*** goddess representing fertility. Although there are many difficulties, we do not know what life will bring us after those difficulties, but we both hope that good things will happen ^.^\n\nIf you want to go on this journey with us and accompany us, our door is always open. We would be very happy to see you as our companions ^.^\n",

I've also saved the current guild information to LindyBlues's [Saved Guild Descriptions](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AZt5n7zeYaKTk7z3PUb3lb-mQcqG427N?usp=drive_link) folder in Google Drive.\n\n---\n\n![Guild Logo: 学 xué - Study Highlighted](https://i.imgur.com/qWFMWyk.jpg \"Credit to joxxxxjo on iStock\")\n*Est.

The old challenge versions are still available if you want to join them, but know that they'll likely be changed within the next couple of months. I'm working on fixing/updating these challenges to help them better suit the needs of the guild. I'll let you know as soon as they're ready; thanks for your patience!  \n\n---\n\nWe have a Memrise group!

Together we can create challenges dedicated to each other's needs and support one another in a journey that can sometimes be quite challenging. \n\n\nIf you have:\n- Mobility limitations\n- Special needs\n- Injuries\n- Dwarfism\n- Mental health issues\n- Any other issues that require a different approach to exercising\n- A need for a safe space to discuss and achieve exercise goals\n- A friend or loved one who ticks any of these boxes and you're looking for ideas on how to help them\n\nThis is the perfect guild to discuss ideas, support each other, create inclusive challenges, share articles and knowledge (from reputable sources) and cheer each other on.\n\nBe very careful when trying new exercises! We don't want you getting injured. When in doubt ask your doctor, your fitness coach, or any other relevant professional whether a workout/exercise is safe for your condition. If at any point you feel hurt or uncomfortable, stop, rest and review your workout.\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\n**Useful links:**\n\n(Feel free to share more interesting resources to be added here)\n\n\n- [How to Exercise with Limited Mobility](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/healthy-living/chair-exercises-and-limited-mobility-fitness.htm)\n\n- [How To: Exercises from Your Wheelchair](https://101mobility.com/blog/wheelchair-exercises/)\n\n- [Top 10 exercises for disabled people](https://disabilityhorizons.com/2016/10/top-10-exercises-disabled-people/)\n\n- [Exercise for People Who Are Blind or Have Low Vision](https://visionaware.org/everyday-living/recreation-and-leisure/sports-and-exercise/exercise-5866/1235/)\n\n- [Physical activity guidelines for older adults](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/physical-activity-guidelines-older-adults/#moderate)\n\n- [How to look after your mental health using exercise](https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/publications/how-to-using-exercise)\n\n- [Blind Alive](https://www.blindalive.com/)\n\n- [Challenging Autism With Exercise](https://journals.lww.com/acsm-healthfitness/fulltext/2017/03000/challenging_autism_with_exercise__an_opportunity.8.aspx)\n\n- [How Sedentary Obese People Can Ease Into Regular Exercise](https://www.healthline.com/health/fitness-exercise/exercise-for-obese-people#4)\n\n- [Exercises for Bedridden Patients](https://care24.co.in/blog/exercises-for-bedridden-patients)\n\n- [Body Feminization Workouts for Trans-Women and Femmes](https://www.wussymag.com/all/2017/1/17/body-feminization-workouts-for-trans-women-and-femmes)\n\n- [A Transmasculine Person’s Guide to Building a Strong Upper Body](https://barbend.com/transmasculine-workout/)\n\n- [Exercise in Pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/pregnancy-exercise/)\n\n- [The Best Exercises for Pregnant Women](https://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/exercises-for-pregnant-women)\n\n- [Dwarf Sports Association UK: Tips for Coaches](https://www.dsauk.org/news/?arin=23)\n\n- [Dwarf Sports Association UK: Useful Links](https://www.dsauk.org/news/index.php?arin=10141)\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\n\n**Useful resources by country:**\n\n\n(Please share more country-specific resources that might help others have access to inclusive and accessible fitness)\n\n\n- [Exercise and Disability: Resources for Accessible Gym Equipment](https://www.ameridisability.com/post/exercise-with-any-kind-of-disability-resources-for-accessible-gym-equipment) (US)\n\n- [Get active with a disability](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/get-active-with-a-disability/) (UK)\n\n- [ESSA: Resources](http://activenation.org.au/resources/) (Australia)\n\n- [Desporto para Pessoas com Deficiências](http://www.idesporto.pt/ficheiros/file/Manuais/GrauI/GrauI-09_DespDeficiencia.pdf) (Portugal)\n\n- [ADD: Escola de Esporte Adaptado](http://www.add.org.br/programa2.asp) (Brasil)\n\n- [Federación Española de Deportes de Personas con Discapacidad Física](http://www.feddf.es/) (España)\n\n- [障害者のフィットネス - 障害保健福祉研究情報システム](https://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/japanese/prdl/jsrd/norma/n337/n337003.html) (日本)\n\n- [Activité physique adaptée et handicap physique](https://www.france-assos-sante.org/2019/03/19/activite-physique-adaptee-et-handicap-physique/) (France)\n\n\n",

Are you a [Faster Auto-Accept Quests and Auto Notify on Quest End](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Faster_Auto_Accept_Quests_and_Auto_Notify_on_Quest_End) script enthusiast? Have you wished your search was a bit more narrowed and concentrated? Well, look no further! This is the guild for you and your auto-accepting parties!  \n___\nHi. My name is Poly, and I wanted to unite parties and provide them a more targeted recruiting experience. I have sought out parties that had this ever since I encountered it in one of my parties. However, they were all over the place: in the official [Party Wanted](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/f2db2a7f-13c5-454d-b3ee-ea1f5089e601) guild, in the [Party Wanted International](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/db4819dd-0efb-4290-989c-9f7625b59a3a) guild, and in the [Habitica Party Roster](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/808d43d6-58f0-407f-8d1a-5aef11544308) guild. I thought... why not create a niche guild that concentrates on this type of questing style? Thus, here I am now with this guild.\n\nThe rules of this guild are similar to the other Party Wanted guilds.

We are all in this together, so let's use this group to give each other the social circle that tends to be missing in the life of someone who works from home.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n“No man needs sympathy because he has to work, because he has a burden to carry. Far and away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.” \n\n― Theodore Roosevelt\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHello everyone!\n&nbsp;\n\n@Acolyte here, your newly-appointed guild leader....erm, herder. (\"Leader\" sounds so formal!) I've been 100% self-employed for 12 years now, and it feels like my specialties have evolved into Putting Out Fires and the ever-popular Doing What Nobody Else Wants To (Or Can) Do. I bounce from accounting to editing, with a bit of podcasting and advertising on the side. I know full well how hard (and sleep-depriving) it can be to exercise the self-discipline needed to get that To Do list completed and meet deadlines. I also know how stressful it can be to balance your work:life ratio, because there is no such thing as \"leaving work at work\" for us!\n&nbsp;\n\nI stand by this statement from @Ameliatron (my predecessor): This guild was originally created by another habitican, @Matt, but in his absence, I am going to be the one simply making sure that the guild runs smoothly. This group does very well on its own, but I am here if you ever need advice or someone to talk to, vent to, or commiserate with you. You can message me anytime for any reason, and please do not hesitate to let me know if you are having any issues with the guild or have suggestions for it. While I have no doubt that everyone in the group will be kind and helpful to one another, it must be stated that unkindness will not be tolerated. \n&nbsp;\n\nThis guild was created as a space for everyone to share their own experiences, ask for advice, express frustration in a safe place, or even get to know each other and socialize a bit (because we all know Habitica is less of a timesuck than those huge social media sites). Here's to success in all of our endeavors - together!",

There's a fine line between executive dysfunction and harmful behaviors, but for the purpose of this Guild we're leaning more toward deliberate decisions.  \n  \nWhy don't we concentrate on not doing anything really stupid to ourselves, **just for today**?  \n   \nToday, having a donut is okay, maybe even a *little* neccessary -- but avoid having the whole box.  \nToday, playing on the computer for a while is fine, but set a limit if other tasks are due.  \nToday, even a little exercise is so much better than none.  \nToday, just finishing even one To-Do is awesome.

Está okay em concordar e discordar de alguns pontos de vista, se todos fossem iguais o mundo seria muito chato. **E TENDO ISSO EM VISTA TENHA RESPEITO AO SE EXPRESSAR!**\n3. Ajude as pessoas que estão com dúvidas, a pessoa irá crescer e ajudar uma outra pessoa.\n4. Política é uma coisa muito importante na sociedade, porém gera muitos conflitos e estresses. Por isso vamos deixar para falar de politica e defender nossas visões para o Twitter. **Aqui não é lugar para falarmos de politica.**\n5. É super aceito levantar maneiras de tornar os espaços de tecnologias mais inclusivos. \n6. Quando você quiser fazer uma propaganda, sinalize que é uma propaganda. Nem todas vão ser bem-vindas aqui, pois fica chato ter muitas mensagens de propaganda de cursos e eventos, principalmente de coisas pagas.\n7. Todas as imagens que forem colocadas nos boards necessitam de um texto alternativo, pois podemos ter pessoas que possuem necessidades visuais.\n8. Qualquer, **QUALQUER MESMO**, demonstração de intolerância e assédio levará ao banimento do grupo. Desejo que essa guilda seja uma experiência excelente para todos, independentemente da identidade e expressão de gênero, orientação sexual, deficiência, neurodiversidade, aparência física, tamanho corporal, etnia, nacionalidade, raça, idade, religião ou outra categoria protegida. **Trate a todos com respeito.**\n9.

Or are you a weekend hiker? =] \nEven if you're trying to get back into it and need motivation or even potential outdoor partners you're welcome here! \n\n~I use to be a highly active person, I was the athlete in the family as my mom called me. In just about every sport that didn't clash in training and games. Followed by hiking, traveling 34 continental states (US), and living in multiple states trekking and camping often to experience the land.\n🌿When I was 21 I had a dirt bike accident that left me physically and mentally out of commission. I have struggled for three years to get back to the shape I was in, and the endurance I had. I'm still working on getting back to or even better than I was! I've lived in three different states since, finding the motivation to safely camp, hike (lightly), and travel to surrounding states. To make it a point to visit state parks, go to beaches, mountains and hot springs. \nI found this motivation from finding people who helped encourage me to continue going and were willing to accompany me incase I had a seizure at the time. Never give up! There will always be people out there that will offer you a hand when you trip on that branch!! I want to help offer you that environment and to have people to help you stay on your habits and goals! \nWe've got this! ♡",

Triple](https://habitica.com/challenges/41fa9dd9-063d-402e-ab21-58cd3364fd5f)\n- [Go Vegan For Your Health, the Animals, and the Planet for 7 days](https://habitica.com/challenges/37901d74-a9b5-421e-b701-8853cd1628b6)\n- [Walk For 1 Hour Every Day](https://habitica.com/challenges/68245ccf-d77a-4910-9037-8a7c0d9d7b36)\n\n🌱 As a personal note, I consider the most important challenge I host to be the vegan one. It not only benefits yourself, but other creatures, the animals, and the environment, in a major way every single day without taking away anything from you. It's as simple as choosing not to have animals be killed for your meals and we have that choice three times a day 🌱\n\n",

(It certainly isn’t monitored by Habitica mods, so there might be other rules there, proceed at your own risk <.<).\n\n[Discord server of r/ADHD](https://discord.gg/gEpqrbS) - rules are definitely different from Habitica, just providing the link in case someone is looking for a more active server than the one of the guild. Proceed at your own risk. \n\nThe [STAG guild](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/59f699a3-9d22-4d6d-b34a-8fcdf2ad1dac) has a body-doubling system on their [Discord server](https://discord.gg/uPh5EtZCUx). They have a whole ADHD channel.\n\nThe [Neurodiverse Universe](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/3b710c44-a2e7-44a5-a4ca-76abfdc777cd) guild welcomes people join their guild and [Discord server](https://discord.gg/WGbz4cmZgj). Some of the rules for the server are mentioned in the description of the guild, make sure to read them before joining.\n\n___\n\n## Permanent Guild Challenges:\n\n+ [Becoming informed about ADHD (Basics)](https://habitica.com/challenges/e3b0db7f-b7b6-4a24-93a6-fa65a1a383df)\n\n+ [Becoming informed about ADHD (Advanced)](https://habitica.com/challenges/82dd39ac-ebd5-455f-b422-3f9d1ba975d1) (I recommend the \"Basics\" challenge over this one, even if you already know things about ADHD)\n\n+ [Appealing Apps for Android ADHDers](https://habitica.com/challenges/39557ed7-0ae1-4126-a574-f6bc7199795a) (check [guild wiki](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/The_Keep:ADHDers_Guild) for more app suggestions for both Android and iOS)\n\n+ [Calibrate Your Internal Clock](https://habitica.com/challenges/912eda5e-ef9d-4ed3-bc28-ab4bf30571ef)\n\n+ [ADHD Goals](https://habitica.com/challenges/d8a6a0fa-2303-4d28-9ef7-585c8b170190)\n\n+ [Save your plants from decay](https://habitica.com/challenges/7e72804d-1a40-48e3-bfe1-06ef86fd7ef2)\n\n+ [Create a Routine and add to it!](https://habitica.com/challenges/98891d86-be1c-4796-b539-7f03c4e58e67)\n\n+ [Thriving with Adult ADHD: Skills to Strengthen Executive Functioning](https://habitica.com/challenges/4fe681db-39af-405d-8eb9-bdc29ef9eca8)\n\n+ [\"Put That Thing Back Where It Came From or So Help Me\" The Musical](https://habitica.com/challenges/3d02979d-08d2-46d9-a044-d0b9ce77fc60)\n\n+ [Fill Up Your Oil Can](https://habitica.com/challenges/8274c811-53f4-4727-b947-db86b02ea395)\n\n+ [Clean up your emails!](https://habitica.com/challenges/edae8e79-8f41-4b63-b9db-8942eef56ddf)\n\n+ [Seasonal Banner(s) for the ADHDers Guild (Pixel Art)](https://habitica.com/challenges/fb2ce51d-fe73-473f-9e51-928c24d31d71)\n\nThe following challenges are sub-challenges of a currently *not* ongoing [yearly challenge](https://habitica.com/challenges/f3ec9b56-fdb7-4b27-9717-cd1b60e4300e).

Всё очень просто. \n\nВыглядит вот так:  \n![отряд](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/717771929452281936/823522793210904586/0cda28e00ea0a936.png \"отряд\") \n\nОтряд наносит и получает урон, зарабатывает золото и, конечно, двигается по сюжету. \nПо ходу сражения мы **выполняем мини-квесты, путём голосования решаем куда пойдёт отряд, что предпримет в той или иной ситуации.**  \n\n![пример](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/717771929452281936/823495646945738783/13.png \"пример\")\n\n### ***Сюжет Сражения за мечту гибкий и непредсказуемый, даже Боги не знают, что ждёт нас завтра.***\n***\n## :ox: **Штурм 2021**  \nМарафонский забег, который продлится до 1 января 2022 года.

While the term \"neurodiverse\" was originally taken up by those on the autism spectrum, it has expanded to cover many other neurodevelopmental conditions such as ADHD, dyslexia, dyscalclia, dysnomia, and dyspraxia. In recent times, it is often used to cover bipolar spectrum conditions, OCD,  and other forms of neurodiversity. \n\nThe aim of the Neurodiverity movement is to spread awareness that neurodevelopmental conditions should not mean that those who are neurodiverse should be excluded from society, and we certainly don't need a \"cure\" or a \"fix\". We are unique and important individuals with our own strengths and abilities, like every other human in the world, and deserve to be respected and treated so.  \n  \n### So who's this guild for? \nThis guild is a place for people from many different walks of life to connect, chat with, and support each other. Feel free to start a discussion, ask for advice, or share your thoughts! \n\n---\n\n**Note about Habitica Guild Chat:** At the moment, Habitica guild chats only hold 200 messages at a time, so it's recommended to try to gather your thoughts into one long message instead of multiple small messages. Please always follow the [Habitica Community Guidelines](https://habitica.com/static/community-guidelines).\n\nWe do have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/WGbz4cmZgj) which you can join and engage as much or as little as you'd like! Info-dumping about interests and asking for advice are welcome there. We aim to make it a safe space for those of us who are neurodivergent to connect and support each other! \n\n**Note:** The guidelines in our Discord server are different from those of Habitica. Please only join the Discord server **if you're 16 or over**. We understand that Habitica is open to those who are over 13, but the server has channels dedicated to sensitive and triggering topics which may be hard to handle without the help of a parent or guardian. There is **no graphic or 18+ content** allowed in our server however. Thank you for understanding! \n\n---\n\n### Resources\n\nHere are some quick links to resources which may be helpful. **If you have any suggestions, feel free to PM the guild leader @OptimumKitten to share them. We could always use more links to resources to help our neurodiverse community!** \n\n[Our Discord Server](https://discord.gg/WGbz4cmZgj)\n\n[ADHDers Guild on Habitica](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/17848f38-0418-4764-9fe8-91fdc9950e32)\n\n[Autistic Adventurer's Guild](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/a205dd09-4578-438b-a87a-275aa2461f2e)\n\n\n---\n\n\n[Adapting Habitica for Autism](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Adapting_Habitica_for_Autism)  \n  \n[Adapting Habitica for ADHD](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Adapting_Habitica_for_ADHD)\n\n[Adapting Habitica for Anxiety and Depression](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Adapting_Habitica_for_Anxiety_and_Depression)\n\n[How to Understand the Autistic Spectrum Comic Strip](https://the-art-of-autism.com/understanding-the-spectrum-a-comic-strip-explanation/)\n\n[ADHD Europe](https://adhdeurope.eu/)\n\n[ADDitude Magazine](https://www.additudemag.com/)\n\n[How to ADHD Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-nPM1_kSZf91ZGkcgy_95Q)\n\n[Translating ADHD Podcast](https://translatingadhd.com/)\n\n[Neurodiversity Sub-Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/neurodiversity/)\n\n[The Dyslexia Resource Website Resources Page](https://dyslexiaresource.org/resources/)\n\n\n",

We accept members of all types, backgrounds, and ages.  \n   \nNew games are always being released, and lately there's been a trend of updating old favorites for the newer consoles.   \n There's always value in nostalgia, whether you long to play the originals all over again  or whether you prefer to wait for the new release, to see how they hold up against your memories.

      "description":"### **If you've ever felt like video games are taking over your life, you're not alone. You're taking a huge step by recognizing it. Few do.**  \n\n___\n\n# **Rules**\n\n* Please try **NOT TO MENTION VIDEO GAME NAMES** in this guild, as they may sound tempting and be potential triggers for some people here\n\n* Please **DO NOT PROMOTE ANY CONTENT OF YOUR OWN** here, unless it's related to the guild's topic and someone has explicitly asked you to do so because they think it could help them in their process with video games\n\n___\n# ❗**Live** Challenge\n[🏆 House cup (July-Oct 2023)](https://habitica.com/challenges/2ed3580a-442e-4093-a562-8fdcf4ba27d8)\n\n## 📜 **House Roster** \n____\n\n🔥 House Blaze\n\n@Lakryma @DragonDM38 @Cheemgles\n___\n🌪️ House Storm\n\n@PulaBear @PMACadet @VWXKEN\n\n___\n\n# **Intro**\n\nA large part of the world's population uses video games and every day there are more and more people who call themselves \"gamers\".\n\nThe origins of video games go back to the 1950s, when shortly after the appearance of the first electronic computers after the end of World War II, the first attempts were made to implement programs of a purely recreational nature. **But years ago they stopped being just recreational.**\n\nToday, video games have become so normalized that there are \"esports\" or electronic sports, video game competitions where the winners receive economic incentives and great recognition worldwide, as if it were a sports competition in real life.\n\nOnly on the Steam platform, the number of video games released went from 9,609 in 2020 to 10,394 in 2021. This growing number of video games is not only due to the demand for entertainment, as it has become another of the main economic industries worldwide. Games industry revenue is expected to top $200 billion for the first time in 2022. This industry spans dozens of job disciplines and employs thousands of people around the world.\n\nBut video games are not just fun and beautiful stories. More and more **games are designed with clear intentions to retain players for the long term** through reward systems, daily login incentives, achievement system, microtransactions, and more.\n\nNot all people who enter the world of video games become addicted, but **a large part of the population has mental conditions that predispose them to become addicted,** such as depression, anxiety, ADHD, autism, among others. Some gamers play as a way of escaping their problems in real life, or simply for entertainment, and end up developing dependent behavior without even realizing it.\n\n`* Check the \"Useful Resources\" section and take a test to find out if you're addicted to video games`\n\n___\n\n# **Gaming Addiction**\n\n## **Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD)**\n\nAccording to the American Psychiatric Association (2013), the clinical diagnosis of IGD comprises a behavioral pattern encompassing persistent and recurrent use of the Internet to engage in online games, leading to significant impairment or distress over a period of 12 months as indicated **by endorsing five (or more) of nine criteria.**\n\n**Diagnostic criteria:**\n\n1. Preoccupation with games  \n2. Withdrawal symptoms when gaming is taken away  \n3. Tolerance, resulting in the need to spend increasing amounts of time engaged in games  \n4. Unsuccessful attempts to control participation in games  \n5. Loss of interest in previous hobbies and entertainment as a result of, and with the exception of, games  \n6. Continued excessive use of games despite knowledge of psychosocial problems  \n7. Deceiving family members, therapists, or others regarding the amount of gaming  \n8. Use of games to escape or relieve negative moods  \n9. Jeopardizing or losing a significant relationship, job, or education or career opportunity because of participation in games. When the severity of IGD is greatly increased, it may lead to academic failure, job loss, or marriage failure as the problem behavior tends to displace usual and expected social, work and/or educational, relationship, and family activities  \n\n## **Gaming Disorder (GD)**\n\n\"Gaming Disorder (GD)\", with its online and offline variants, has been included in the 11th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) (released in mid 2018) as a **clinically recognizable and clinically significant syndrome,** when the pattern of gaming behaviour is of such a nature and intensity that it results in marked distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational or occupational functioning.\n\nStudies suggest that gaming disorder affects only a small proportion of people who engage in digital- or video-gaming activities. However, **people who partake in gaming should be alert to the amount of time they spend on gaming activities, particularly when it is to the exclusion of other daily activities,** as well as to any changes in their physical or psychological health and social functioning that could be attributed to their pattern of gaming behaviour.\n\n**Diagnostic criteria:**\n\n1. Impaired control over gaming (e.g., onset, frequency, intensity, duration, termination, context)  \n2. Increasing priority given to gaming to the extent that gaming takes precedence over other life interests and daily activities  \n3. Continuation or escalation of gaming despite the occurrence of negative consequences  \n\nGD should only be diagnosed when the behavior pattern is of sufficient severity to result in significant impairments in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.\n\nFor a diagnosis to be assigned, the pattern of gaming behavior should be continuous or episodic and recurrent, and the gaming behavior and its associated features should be normally evident over a period of at least 12 months. **Nonetheless, the required diagnostic duration may be shortened** if all diagnostic requirements are met and symptoms are severe.\n\n___\n\n# **Gaming Addiction Symptoms**\n\nI took the liberty of gathering the symptoms mentioned by the World Health Organization and breaking them down with specific examples, based on my experience of addiction and that of others:\n\n**Preoccupation**\n- You are constantly thinking about video games and it is difficult for you to focus on your daily activities\n- You count the hours until you can play again\n- Video games are your only or greatest source of self-esteem, they are the only place where you feel comfortable\n\n**Withdrawal symptoms**\n- When you are not playing you feel much more irritable, anxious or depressed. You have sudden mood swings\n\n**Tolerance**\n- You feel that each time you have to play more hours or spend more money on video games to feel the same level of satisfaction every time\n- You feel you must play because you have a responsibility to the game, to your character, or to the community that you interact with within the game\n\n**Lack of control**\n- You've already tried to quit video games or reduce the number of hours you play, but you can't\n- You continue to play even though you have considered that video games have a negative impact on your life\n\n**Loss of interest in other activities**\n- Whether it be sports, social activities, hobbies, and more. Especially if they were activities that you liked a lot before\n\n**Disappointment**\n- You feel disappointed in your behavior with video games\n- You have a hard time being honest about this behavior or about the hours you spend playing video games\n\n**Escapism**\n- You play video games to escape or relieve a negative mood and rarely think about possible solutions to your problems\n\n**Loss of opportunities**\n- You have missed work or study opportunities because you are playing, or you have a hard time keeping your current job due to the number of hours spent playing the game\n- You have cut love relationships or any relationship important to you, for dedicating much more time to video games than to those people\n\n___\n\n**Sources:**\n\n[World Health Organization website](https://www.who.int/news/item/14-09-2018-inclusion-of-gaming-disorder-in-icd-11)  \n[Measurement and Conceptualization of Gaming\nDisorder According to the World Health Organization](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11469-019-00088-z)\n\n___\n\n# **My Story**\n\nI'm Isaac, the creator of this community, and **I have played video games for about 16 of my 24 years.** I started with the GameBoy Advance SP in 2006, then got an Xbox in 2008, and finally got into online computer gaming around 2009.\n\nSince I got the Xbox, my mom hid it from me several times to prevent me from playing for more than 4 hours a day, and after repeating it a few times, it eventually worked to reduce my anxiety to play.\n\nWhen I tried my first online game, I was fascinated by it. **I played on the computer 6-8 hours a day for many days in a row** and my mother grounded me, she set strict hours for me to use the computer and made me go to sleep early, but this was not enough.\n\n> I would lock myself in my room, turn off the light, and pretend to be asleep until my mom fell asleep, so I could get up and continue playing. It was only until this point that I first became aware that the situation was getting out of hand.\n\nSometimes **I would even fall asleep and set an alarm at 3-4 a.m. to get up and continue playing until 7-8 a.m.** and turn off the computer before my mother got up. Several times she caught me playing at dawn and kept putting more and more restrictions on me, and so it took a long time (perhaps years) until I really reduced the time I spent playing.\n\nAfter that recovery, I had several relapses of approximately 2 consecutive months each, in which I would play out of control until the early morning or even not sleep at all, **leaving aside my biggest goals and passions in life,** just because I had no time for them or I just didn't care anymore.\n\n> I've lost count of how many times I've uninstalled my most played game telling myself I'll never play it again, and even gave away my main account (with 10+ years cumulative progress in the game) to a complete stranger so there was no way for me to get it back. And still, I got back in the game with a new account.\n\nThis is just one video game example and one of the testimonials of how damaging competitive video games and addictive reward systems can be. \n\nToday I continue to have relapses, but increasingly shorter and sporadic. Now the feeling of annoyance generated by **wasting hours that I could dedicate to sleep or personal projects** prevents me from repeating it for several days in a row.\n\nHabitica has helped me a lot on that topic recently. However I am very careful not to let their reward system become another harmful cycle or time stealer like any video game. I know my weakness.\n\n`* If you have identified with my story at least once in your life, you should read the whole guild description`\n\n___\n\n# **Donors**\n\neddie @eddieL  \nLizard Wizard 🐍 💔 @AinFach\n\nThe people mentioned above have contributed by donating gems, thus supporting guild maintenance and challenge creation.

      "description":"Do you go to Burning Man or Regional Burns? Do you try to live according to the 10 principles? Are you brilliant, beautiful and more than a little mad?  Join the guild. Do you have no idea what I'm talking about? Are you one of society's round pegs? Join anyway! We are radically inclusive. \n\n**Radical Inclusion**  \n\nAnyone may be a part of Burning Man. We welcome and respect the stranger. No prerequisites exist for participation in our community.  \n\n**Gifting ** \n\nBurning Man is devoted to acts of gift giving. The value of a gift is unconditional. Gifting does not contemplate a return or an exchange for something of equal value.  \n\n**Decommodification**  \n\nIn order to preserve the spirit of gifting, our community seeks to create social environments that are unmediated by commercial sponsorships, transactions, or advertising. We stand ready to protect our culture from such exploitation. We resist the substitution of consumption for participatory experience.  \n\n**Radical Self-reliance**  \n\nBurning Man encourages the individual to discover, exercise and rely on his or her inner resources.  \n\n**Radical Self-expression ** \n\nRadical self-expression arises from the unique gifts of the individual. No one other than the individual or a collaborating group can determine its content. It is offered as a gift to others.  \n\n**Civic Responsibility**  \n\nWe value civil society. Community members who organize events should assume responsibility for public welfare and endeavor to communicate civic responsibilities to participants. They must also assume responsibility for conducting events in accordance with local, state and federal laws.  \n\n**Leaving No Trace**  \n\nOur community respects the environment. We are committed to leaving no physical trace of our activities wherever we gather. We clean up after ourselves and endeavor, whenever possible, to leave such places in a better state than when we found them.  \n\n**Participation**  \n\nOur community is committed to a radically participatory ethic. We believe that transformative change, whether in the individual or in society, can occur only through the medium of deeply personal participation. We achieve being through doing. Everyone is invited to work. Everyone is invited to play. We make the world real through actions that open the heart.  \n\n**Immediacy**  \n\nImmediate experience is, in many ways, the most important touchstone of value in our culture. We seek to overcome barriers that stand between us and a recognition of our inner selves, the reality of those around us, participation in society, and contact with a natural world exceeding human powers. No idea can substitute for this experience.",

Its steps are nothing new if you've read any \"break it down\" style of productivity tips, but I found the wording of how to draft my goals very helpful. That's why there are lots of caps and exclamation points! :) What I'm working on has to be exciting to me otherwise I'm just going to resort back to whatever is easiest and forget goals. \n\nI'll be posting accountability updates here as regularly as I can and commenting on others. This is a rolling challenge so you can join whenever you'd like, but if you want a gem at the end send me a message at the beginning of your challenge and I'll check in with you for a gem reward at the end.\n\n## Step 1 - Define your SUPER AWESOME IMPORTANT THING\nYour SUPER AWESOME IMPORTANT THING represents a destination - set a clear direction and inspire yourself. This super awesome important thing does NOT contain a number. It should excite you to read/see it! It is aspirational and challenges you to be innovative and creative. \"What am I working towards without focusing on the tasks?”\n\n_Examples:_\n\n-_Gain a sense of purpose and contribution towards the world_\n\n-_Live a long and happy life_\n\n-_Expand my creativity_\n\n-_Become closer with my friends/family_\n\n-_Learn continuiously_\n\n-_Have more fun!_\n\nCheck out the challenge for the rest of the guidelines.",

This is also an amazing space to find other people to play games with, or at least make some new friends to play games with later.  II may make some challenges in the future, so watch out for those!  As this group grows, I'll look into adding auxiliary resources to the guild to help us  - perhaps a spreadsheet with friend codes or a  document with links to helpful videos, online tools, or other online communities.\n\nTo link up with other members in the guild, use Pool code \"Habitica\".

      "description":"# WHAT IS CLINICAL BURN OUT SYNDROME\n\nClinical Burn out Syndrome means that you have several different bodily and mental problems that are due to prolonged stress or other severe stresses. With support and treatment, you recover, although you may be, for example, stress-sensitive for a long time. For some, recovery takes a long time. \n\n**SYMPTOMS**\n \nThe symptoms of clinical Burn out syndrome are almost always both physical and psychological. Most often, you have also had one or more stress-related problems for a long time before you get sick.\n\nWhich problems or disorders are most evident in clinical Burn out syndrome varies from person to person. It is common to have several of the following problems: \n\n* You have no energy and experience a great fatigue that cannot be rested away.\n* You feel exhausted.\n* You have trouble falling asleep or wake up many times during the night.\n* You're irritable, worried and depressed.\n* You have anxiety.\n* You forget things and have difficulty concentrating.\n* You have trouble planning and completing tasks.\n* You have physical problems such as palpitations, dizziness and aches.\n* You are very sensitive to sound.\n* You may get different types of problems from the stomach and intestines.\n\n**SOLUTION**\n\n**Go to the doctor and getting the information for your situation.** \nEveryones burn out is different and different things might work for you. Usually resting the RIGHT amount and the RIGHT amount of activity is key to get back. What that means is different for everyone. You got to find the right balance for where you stand today.\n\n# GOOD HABITS WHEN YOU'RE WORN OUT\n\nHabits are based on advices I've been given from experts regarding my loong lived burn out: \n\n**RIGHT AMOUNT WALKS**\n\n:smiley: Give your self some creds for your right-amount-walk. \nWalk every other day or every day when you get a bit better. \n\n*The walk has to be the right length for where you're at. A too long walk can make you wake up drained of energy the next day and is contraproductive.*\n\n**REST AND ACTIVITY BALANCE**\n\n:smiley: Give your self some cred after not doing it all at once and taking rest. \n\nTry to devid houshold work, not taking all the dishes at once it that makes you tired. make sure to rest after an activity like a walk or making food. \n\n*What is rest for you? This might vary in different stages of the burn out. Make sure that rest isnt television or scrolling on the phone.*\n\n:smiley: Give your self Creds för saying NO. \n\n*Since you are burned out. The likelyhood that you say yes more often than others is big. The thought of saying No might even make you feeling anxious or guilty.* \n\n:rage: Give minus points when you exhaust your self\n\n*To get better it's best to keep a balance. Dont exhaust your self for no reson.* \n\n**MINDFULNESS**\n\n:smiley: Give you self some creds for trying you best to be here and now. \n\n *Just try to be present as often you can remind youself with out pressuring you self.*\n\n**RELAXATION OR MEDITATION EXERCISE**\n\n:smiley: Give you self some cred for doing an exercise. \n\n*Rest the brain with an exercise. Find an exercise or exercises that you find helpful to relax.*\n",

      "description":"Everyone has to follow Community Guidelines. To be added to the description, DM @princesspenn. And I bet you're wondering what Error Productions is, right? Well, it's an old company that has a dark past (hehe). Additionally, you can find lore in this old company :)) \n\nAnd a big thank you to @blastyboi25 for helping with the creation of this guild !!\n      Rp characters:\n\nBlasty aka @blastyboi25:\n\nBlasty (he/him) has black wolf/shag cut hair with curtain bangs, wears an oversized black shirt and baggy sweats with all-black ankle combat boots. He has chains and metal tools hanging from his sweats, with bigger metal tools in a holder on his back. Blasty has physical and mental issues but hides how he is feeling. He gets irritated very easily and very depressed very easily, but no one knows. He has the ability to manipulate metal tools, knives-daggers-swords. He also has the ability to manipulate nuclear blasts into and with anything he wants. He became so good with his abilities that people started to call him, and know him mainly as Metal Explosion because he combines both abilities and creates flaming metal tools that come from his hands. Due to his outstanding expertise, he was asked to join Error Productions as a master worker and as a protector of the company.\n\n\n\nError & tip @Princesspenn:\n   \nError: (it/it’s/xe)\n\nTip: (they/them) tip is actually build by Error themself from older blueprints now one of the cast members of the live shows; when tip turned sentient they still remembered Company Secrets and [redacted] stuff but doesn’t say anything about it\n\n@ruunaser:\nI’ll be playing Wilhelmina “Cogs” Livingstone (she/they), a nerdy neurodivergent mechanic who loves trains like nothing else. She has a plain white pirate-style shirt with the sleeves rolled up, snug dark pants tucked into tall work boots, a tool belt, and a vest that’s both stylish and practical. They’ve probably got lockpicks in there. Her hair used to be brown, but they’ve gotten it so stained with machine oil that it’s mostly black at this point.\n\n\n786-B & widget aka @K-Leeridot :\n\n\nBulkie 786-B: A sentient Bulkie machine that was assigned to work heavy jobs in the Error Productions building. After the termination of it's beloved co-bot, 786-A, due to an incident within the company, 786-B had become hostile, and was locked up in a far sector of the building. Bulkies, as with most other automations, have serial numbers instead of names. Bulkies have large bodies with wide legs to keep them stable. An oil pack can be found on the inside as a way to keep them moving as they worked. Their eyes double as lights; this has worked well in occasions when lights were low or out completely. Bulkies are usually equipped with special arms that assit in their jobs. 786-B has three-finger grabbing claws on its arms.\n\nWidget: One of the cast members in the Error Productions live shows, Widget was built to be small and nimble enough to wear clothes so it could fit the part. Because Widget was cast mainly as a shy, male character, it became part of it's personality when it turned completely sentient. Widget has no knowledge of any company secrets or incidents, and always tries to ensure the Stage was treated right. Along with other automation cast members, Widget is found somewhere in the Main Theatre sector. Automations like Widget are built to appear human-like, and have been painted to resemble usual skin tones as well. Widget is painted a light cream, but as of recent it's been chipping off.\n\nEyana aka @justadvena\n\nEyana:\nA girl who looks around fifteen, dressed in a puffy white blouse and high waist brown skirt. She carries a weird contraption that resembles a gramophone and a cinematograph combined, with a tiny golden clock that ticks counter clockwise embedded in its middle. Quiet and reserved, never let go of her machine and dislike other people touching it. She end up at the doorstep of the company somehow, seeking expert advice on her machine -- on which the clock seems to be ticking more slowly.\n\nAloy aka @Xx1ash1xX\n\nName: Aloy \n Age: 17 \nStory: Sadness, despair and others. She joined Error Productions to create a new life for herself where everything would be fair and she would be paid as much as any other human would\n\nSome things to keep in mind: We use code for actions. For example, “!well hello folks¡ `error says walking around the stage`\" How to do code? Use the backtick, which looks like this - \" ` \", so use a backtick at the beginning of your action and at the end of your action. // Another thing to keep in mind: Please specify when you are in and out of character to avoid a mix-up in the chat :)) For example, when out of character - \"Out of character: Has anyone found lore?\"\n\n\nName: Cherimoya/Cherri\nAge: 14\nGender/Pronounds: she/her/they/them\nS&S (Optional): pansexual & demigirl\nRef/Desc (Ref optional): black hair with natural blue streaks there from birth, tan skin, one eye is blue one is green (they have heterochromia), has black wings with blue streaks.\nPers: funny, sarcastic, protective\nOther: can control plants",

A moon later, everyone presume that their dead, in a different clan, bacame pettycats or a rouges.\n\nHello, I would like another oc to the Warrior Cat RP. Here is his disc: \n\n@Hyro_Stars AKA Blazekit is a 5 moon old kit who lives in Valleyclan. He is a black and red, spotted tabby tom, with short fur, and amber eyes.  He will later on become bi after his appearance ceremony. He is usually quiet around the bigger cats(Warriors and Lead), but is super playful when around other kits. He has a scar on his back from where his father(who shall not be named) attacked him during his sleep when he was younger, he is the brother of Willowkit. \n\n@ameliaofpotts AKA Foamkit. She is a light blue she with white points. She has white speckles on her body, and cyan eyes. She is kind, playful, lighthearted, way to precious for this evil world, and she would do anything for her friends. She was welcomed as a young and starving kit under a bush into the clan.\n\n\n**Out of Valleyclan:**\n\nRavenpaw AKA Ravenpaw. A maine coon she-cat with pitch black fur and a white tail tip. One eye is startling green, the other is calm blue. She's thin but well muscled, and likes to swim and climb trees. Usually she's quite laid back, but she works hard during training, and sneaks out almost every night to practice tree climbing. She's also gentle and kind, so she would help other cats in the clan. She now lives in Willowclan\n\nDarkpaw: black tom with an orange stripe in the middle of his eyes (willowclan)  (Might be MIA)\n\nBethany-T aka Fern:   Long-haired light brown tabby she-cat with green eyes, black paws and a white tail tip. Until she joins, her name will be Fern. She would like her to join as a kit who is about five moons old.  She is usually calm and friendly. She has a female red-tailed hawk companion named Skystrike. \n\nSussy_Baka:  Shadow and He is a Rouge. He doesn't trust clan cats or two-legs. His sister, mom, and dad were all killed in a war. He was in Willowclan growing up. He loves swimming and climbing. His coat is black with white and it's a medium thick coat of fur. His left eye is blue and his right eye is green. He is 24 moons old. He is a thief, and a skinner cat.  (Might be MIA)\n\n@ameliaofpotts AKA Her name is Squawk! She is kinda small but smart! She doesn’t talk much but she is very kind when she does. She is a female, as you may have noticed, and is a loner. She is very thin, and does not have much food where she lives, near Twolegs. If she catches any food, which she isn’t that good at, which means she won’t get much, it is normally stolen by the twoleg’s dogs. And as for her coat, it is dull ginger, and she has black patches everywhere. Some are big, some are spaced out, her left ear is completely black, and it is like someone dropped paint on her! She had a black paw and saddle patch. She is so skinny you can see her ribs through her pelt! She has heterochromia, so her left eye is a dull red, and her right eye is a faint, nearly white blue. If she joins the clans and gets healthier, you won’t be able to see her ribs, she will have a bright blue eye and a light maroon eye, and a bright ginger tabby pelt. Squawk used to be a plump Kittypet who loved looking at the trees. Her name was Feathery. She was a brave she, and once the dog ate her food, and growled at her. She hissed at him and her twolegs thought she was trying to be mean. They took her and the dog on a monster ride, but to Feathery’s dismay, they threw her out. She ran away to another twoleg nest but they refused to let her in. She hunted for food, and caught a single mouse. She went to eat it, but it was stolen by a dog. \n\n@ameliaofpotts AKA He shall be Foxwood, a ginger Tom with a very dark half of his face. He has the same dark color on his tail like stripes going around it, and his rear stripes are in the middle of the two colors I mentioned. His underbelly is the slightly lighter version of his main ginger, and he has lots of brindle on his face and body. It is the same dark color. He has stripes on his face, which on his light side are dark, and on his dark side is light. On his body, he has swirls going around his brindle that are the middle color. He also has a saddle marking that is the same color as his swirls. He is a stubborn Tom who is large, loyal, brave, and grumpy, but when he went into Starclan he became kinder. \n\n@BattleOfTheWarwings AKA Havok is a dark grey second-generation rogue with yellow eyes and white paws. Because his mother, Sharpclaw, was banished from BurrowClan, he wishes to destroy all the clans by tricking them into warring. He goes by the fake name Hawk.\n \nFrog-Blobby AKA A cat called Shadowpaw with soot black fur and grey paws with deep blue eyes. About 12 moons old. He has never had a friend in his life and always works alone. Very rarely loses prey and does not forgive easily.\n\nCrystal724 A.K.A. Crystal is a six month old poofy white Persian with pale blue eyes. Her parents were bred by breeders, but she was the least cute looking, so she was dumped. Unfortunately, Crystal inherited a short snout and small nose, making her have mild breathing problems and be less active than most cats. As she wondered around the forest, hopeless, she got stuck in a patch of thorn bushes and had to yank a lot of her fur out to get free.\n\n@Lil_Bil A.K.A. A ginger kit with pale green eyes who is 5 moons old. (Pronouns: she/her) She was born inside Valley clan territory and her parents were loners. She was born in a litter of 3 but her siblings and her parents were killed by a badger and she managed to run away and her tail got stuck in a thorn bush. Her parents named her dusky but she will be named dusky kit once cat find her.\n\n\n{More information about the clan name and other clans to come!}\n\n**CLANS**\n\n__Burrow Clan:__ Burrowclan occupies the bottom left of all the clan's territories. The land is dotted with many hills. The clan cats live in a big burrow once dug by a badger many years ago that is placed towards the back of their territory. The cats who live in Burrowclan are skilled jumpers and runners, knowing how to quickly cross the hill-y lands. \n\n__Willow Clan:__ Willowclan is in the top left of all the clan's territories. Willowclan is vastly known for its dense forests full of big willow trees and oak trees. They live in a gigantic willow tree that is in the middle of their territory. A river wounds around it and the cats made their dens in the gigantic roots. These cats are skilled climbers, they're almost like squirrels being able to jump between trees and knowing how to perfectly balance among them. Leader: Beechstar Deputy: Mapleshade\n\n__Valley Clan:__ (The one we all currently play in) Valleyclan is to the right of Burrowclan. The land is mostly hills towards the border they share with burrow clan, as you go more in-land the hills become steeper and more like cliffs. The land is flatter towards their shared border with Groveclan. This is where more of the shrubs and a few maple trees are studded around. A big river from Willowclan crosses into their land rushing closely to their camp. The camp is towards the back right, in a deep valley. The top of the valley has a few birch trees to shelter but the great walls of the valley do most of the sheltering. The front of the camp faces towards burrow can, it was a careful slope downwards but the cats had created a tunnel over it making it harder for anything to charge in. Across from the entrance was a pond, part of the river fed off down into the valley and collected into the puddle. In the wall next to the waterfall a rock jutted out and vines hung over it shielding off the leader's den. The medics den was on the left side of the valley's walls, close to the pond. The entrance had little flowers sprouting around it. The first part of the room was rounded out with some mossy nests for any patients, the right of the wall had been carved out to look over the pond. The back room was where the medic and the herbs were. Their were rocky shelves as if carved by water long ago, the herbs lined these. The nursery was on the right wall across from the medicine den. The entrance had woven bracken around it with little spring flowers in place. There was a tunnel made to go in, small enough for a cat but no bigger for a badger. Bracken was pushed against the walls too, to act as another protection. The tunnel opened up into a circular room. Large mossy nests were around the walls, feathers and some animal fur was mixed in as well. It was dark except for a small window like opening on the left wall which opened out into the pond, it wasn't low enough to the ground for any kits to escape out of. The elders den was next to the medics den, it had a similar style to the nursery but the tunnel was shorter and the room was smaller. The warriors and apprentice dens were on either side near the entrance to the valley. They were large circular rooms with very high ceilings and many mossy nests dotted around. These cats are agile climbers and swift runners. \n\n__Groveclan:__ The clan in the top right of the whole territory. It has a thin forest of tall maple trees all around its forest, a very flat land and it has a lot of clovers and little flowers growing around. Their camp is somewhere around the left back of their territory. Its made in a big dip in the ground. They tend to be the stronger of the cats due to the animals (badgers, foxes, etc) that find their territory the best to live in. \n\n**Special place:**\nMeeting place is the fourpillars (as suggested by tinykit) which is 4 old ancient pillars that still stand from the ancient times of the two-legs. Each leader sits on the pillars during the full moon gatherings. \n\n\nPrevious leaders:\n-Leafless ( Gingerstar: She is a Maine coon tortoiseshell, she has a white base and orange and dark brown spots all over her fur. She has deep brown eyes and an orange spot running up her nose. Her hind paws have brown spots and her front paws are normal white)\n-Graywing \nC_ (C_[Sasha][Tavern Guy]he/they/e) AKA: Swiftclaw: Medium-sized Tomcat with Dark brown fur with gray spots, bright blue eyes, and black paws with brown spots on them.\n\nxX1Ash1Xx: Darkstar has she/they pronouns and is a melanistic black footed cat. She has blue eyes.What most cats don't know is that she has a small white diamond on her throat and she tries to hide it because she thinks it's ugly. She's very nice, but is kind of unwilling to lead. She'll lead the clan as best as possible, but is scared of power. She likes female cats as mates, but she isn't scared of males. She is a great hunter and she has almost no lost prey\n\n\nPrevious med app: Soartblockisathing AKA Flowerpaw: Light ginger color with white paws and underbelly. Her left ear is white and she has greyish-green eyes. ",

      "description":"This Guild just started out, I will add descriptions and links with time :)\n\nThe Human Design System is a compelling synthesis of ancient and modern sciences, including eastern and western empirical and esoteric systems of knowledge.\nIt is a precise tool for life advice. With study and application, it also furthers the advancement of human consciousness and growth.\n With Human Design you discover what makes you different from everyone else. It offers profound insights into your psychology, along with strategies and techniques for making correct decisions and ultimately leading to a life of more ease and fulfillment. \n\nIn this group we discuss our findings and insights of our individual Human Design Experiment, and encourage each other to live by strategy and inner authority.\n\n\nHuman Design is the science of differentiation. It combines wisdoms such as Astrology, Kabbala, I Ging, Chakra, Genetics and quantum physics into a new system that gives you a very accurate description of who you where designed to be in this incarnation. It combines science and spirituality, but it works whether you believe in one or the other. You do not need any prior knowledge in the mentioned fields to understand Human Design.\n\n\n## *Where to get started:*\n\nYou need your birthdate, location and time. To get all details correct it's important to know your birthtime as accurately as possible. Depending on country you can view your birth certificate or office to see your correct birthtime. \n\n\n[get your free chart](https://thehumandesignsystem.com/free-chart/)\n\n\nWhat you get is your birthchart, it's a visual representation of all the information Human Design provides.\n\n[get a free quick overview of what your chart means](https://human.design/chart-reports/free)\n\nThe two most important information you'll get are your strategy and authority. If you live by those two advice you will automatically live out your whole chart. So that's the best way to get started with the experiment. Start seeing when and where your decision and interaction was made with strategy and authority or without, and take notice whether there's a difference. Try and actively live by strategie and authority and see what happens.\n\nIt's best to view HD as an Experiment. Instead of viewing the advice given as new dogmatic rules think of them as \"what happens if i follow the suggestion, what happens if I don't? Do I see the claims Human Design makes reflected in my own live?\"\n\nOften times we are very deep conditioned by our familiy and surroundings to believe certain things about our self or our environment. It's hard to learn to listen to your body and listen to it to make a decision. Our \"rational\" world forbids decision made by heart or gut instinct. HD tells us to get back into our body and listen to our reaction instead of forcing everything by our mind. The specific way of how to make a decision is called \"authority\" in human design. There are 9 types of authority. \n\n** overview over the elements of HD**\n\nthere are 5 aura types: this is how your aura works and the strategy that best suits you for navigating your daily interaction with life\n\n9 authoritys: depending on your defined center one of the 9 inner authoritys is the way you make decision that are suited best for you personaly. roughly 50% of the population have solar plexus (emotional) authority. They live out an emotional wave and shouldn't make decisions in the moment but wait a couple of days before making important decisions. If an emotional authority makes a decision in the moment it will be informed by their current mood and later on, when the mood shifted they might realize the decision was wrong, or they don't like it any longer.\naround 30% of the population have sacral authority, that is a strong gut feeling. It's a strong and immidiate \"oh yes\" reaction. The \"no\" reaction might be a bit subdued though.\n\nthere are 12 profiles: This is the back and bone of your character and is present in the way you interact with life.\n\n9 energy centers\n\n64 gates\n\nand 32 chanels-\n\ndepending on where the planets stood at your birth these gates, channels and centers are either defined or undefined within your chart.\n\nIf you're intrigued please google a bit. there's ton of information. for the moment I just try to give a small breakdown, there's much more than would fit here",

Our aim is to build a small community that is safe and supportive.  It is our hope that here you’ll find the encouragement and companionship you need to overcome obstacles, make time for the things that matter and really enjoy working on your projects and living life. \n\n**The Chat**  \nWe want a sensitive, kind, encouraging atmosphere in the chat so that people can feel comfortable talking about their projects and experiences.  \n-  Feel free to talk about your successes, worries, obstacles, what you did - today, anything you would like to share.  \n-  Please avoid advice and comments that promote comparison, perfectionism, or overwork.  It’s perfectly okay to struggle with these and to talk about those struggles - that’s one of the reasons why this guild exists.  \n\n**Seizazen's habit tracker**  \nShared with the guild for extra accountability   \n[google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MZl77VGKPM_p4YukIcujjnZ0olRJHrwlmn3nJ15ly1A/edit#gid=0)  \n",

      "description":"\n---\n\n## You & The Mystery Train\n\n![SpringTrain](https://i.postimg.cc/FKJS1Tjj/choochoo.png \"Train Spring\")\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nWelcome to the Mystery Train, Habitica’s only tour around the Guilds and other places of wonder.  The engine was born from the seed of a star and now it runs on the dreams of Habiticans across the world.  Why would you come aboard?  Because you found a ticket in your pocket.  Take a ride on the Mystery Train as we journey to Guilds large and small.  Perhaps you will find a place you would like to visit again.  Perhaps you will meet another passenger that will change your life.  This is the way of the Mystery Train!  \n\n**Please note that role play in this guild is limited to non-violent train-related activities.**\n\n\nThe [wiki page](https://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/The_Keep%3AThe_Mystery_Train) details information about previous stops, role playing conventions, established settings/rail cars, and challenge winners.\n\n**TRAIN CREW**\n\nEngineer: Gloomheart @daringheart \n\nTrain Crew: @OneWhoDreamz, @PizzaMyHeart, @CassiusVonthill, @Linsanity, @Helthazard and @Allors4612.  Crew members may punch or stamp tickets, guide Train-based role play, answer questions about the Train, publish progress reports, and summon moderators if necessary.\n\nThe Mystery Train was set in motion by Gloomheart, who was the First Engineer. Others have directed the directed the Train, notably Gloom's best friend Cinnamon Toast. We made our first stop at the Redholme Fighters' Guild on May 12, 2018.\n\n-------------------------------\n### :railway_car: Train Route\n\n#### Currently stationed:  The Mystery Train now rests in a warehouse near Habit City.  Inside the sprawling warehouse are trinkets, treasure, and memorials. You are surrounded by staircases, wells, and doorways. \nAbove the train is a huge bulletin of routes. Passengers begin to choose places to go, hither and yon. This list can be found in this [shared google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AZt5n7zeYaKTk7z3PUb3lb-mQcqG427N) in the document titled *Discord Servers & Other New Homes for Guilds*.\n\n#### Previous stops are listed on [The Keep page](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/The_Keep:The_Mystery_Train#Previous_stops)\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n***If you would like The Mystery Train to visit your Guild, please message*** @Gloomheart\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n## The Conductors insist on the following rules:\n\n+  Do not abuse or harass any Guild that we visit. We are invited guests. Any violation of [Community Guidelines](https://habitica.com/static/community-guidelines) will be reported immediately.\n\n+  Violators will be deposited at our stops at the Fortress of Neglect or the Swamps of Stagnation.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## On Roleplaying:\n\nRoleplaying occurs on the Mystery Train, but please remember that the majority of the passengers are just along for the ride, checking in now and then because they are curious to visit new guilds.  Extensive roleplay is not the primary purpose of this guild.  We're exploring different guilds and chatting about them.  We do minor roleplay about being on a train which is stopping at guild stations, and occasional holiday storylines.  \n\nIf you want to join a more intensive roleplay with other creative and very active Mystery Train passengers, you can step into the shadowy car just behind the caboose, with the sign above the door saying [Role Players in Exile](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/7e3d53c0-f0de-4ae0-9a4c-07995bf6173d). \n\nPlease observe the following conventions when roleplaying:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n:thumbsup: Keep your (virtual) hands to yourself unless you know the other player wants to engage in role play with you.  Do not assume or direct the actions of another's avatar unless you have consent.\n&nbsp;\n\n:speech_balloon: Out-of-character (i.e. your voice) is prefaced with //slashes\n&nbsp;\n\n:train: Text in “quotes” is spoken from your character/avatar\n&nbsp;\n\n:dancer: When your character is emoting or performing an action, use the `code` function wrapping your text in ` (backtick/grave accent).  This character may be difficult to locate on your keyboard.  \n&nbsp;\n:link: Here is an [external link](https://superuser.com/questions/254076/how-do-i-type-the-tick-and-backtick-characters-on-windows/254077#254077) showing various locations of the backtick/grave accent on various keyboards\n\n\n***Examples:***\n\n `Gloomheart toots the whistle.`  \n\"That's a fine whistle,\"  `Gloomheart says proudly.`  \n//Yes, I like pickles.\n\n\n**The Trick To Including Stuff in Red Text**\n\nIf you want to include an emoji in the middle of the red text, you have to end the red text before the emoji, type its code in regular font, and restart using red text after it. Same for including somebody's @whoever tag in red text. Apparently, two special code things at once is not possible.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDon’t forget you can test your [markdown](https://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Markdown_Cheat_Sheet) by PMing yourself.\n\n## Challenges\n\nPassengers are welcome to create their own challenges. Please create clear guidelines in your challenges, including expectations and expiration dates. Help and suggestions are available on the Wiki.\n\n---",

She has no power over us or *our* magical world.  \nWe specifically want to *encourage trans people and others who got hurt by the original author, or are critical towards her story, to come and join our magical world*, and help shape it so it becomes what we want.

This is the place to come if you are creative to share ideas, ask questions, or get ideas from others. We love creative DIY projects of all sorts!\n\nCurrent Challenge: [November Challenge](https://habitica.com/challenges/61e48b04-acbc-4af4-b785-b5f31324bf4a) No-Waste November - re-use existing items and create something new!\n\n### How to link photos.\n\nthe syntax is:\n[Hyperlink name]*no space here*(Link address)\n \nExample: \n\nHyperlink name: Pelican\n\nlink address:  https://imgur.com/gallery/67lIbYf\n\nAll together looks like this: [Pelican](https://imgur.com/gallery/67lIbYf)\n\n### Monthly Contests\n- **January**: winner of the January challenge is ; @ congrats!! P\n\n- **February** : Freakout February - Share a horror story with us! Be it the time you started a fight with the beltsander and the sander won, or maybe you have a super early Halloween project (some of us just like the asthetic ok!?). Show off your battle scars, and your spoopy projects.\n\n- **March**: Mastercraft - take this month to get back to basics and polish up those base skills that are the foundation of every master. \n\n- **April**: Amazing Characters - We all have a favourite book, movie, TV show. Why not spend the time to re-create something that reminds you of them?!\n\n- **May**: Magical Mayhem - what is magic to you? Be it Vegas style Copperfield, mythological Merlin; find a way to incorporate this theme into your work, and share with the guild your own touch of magic. \n\n- **June**: Jettin' June - everyone has vacation on their mind... so let us focus on some projects that can take us away! Wish you were at the beach - do something with sand. Prefer mountains.... use moss!\n\n- **July**: Keep Cool July - It's hot. What craft can you do to help keep cool??\n- **August**: August Animals - Do something for an animal, with animals on it, made of animal prints to celebrate the amazing creatures our world has.\n\n- **September**:  \n- **October**: Oddities  - Do something out of the norm. Try a new craft, practice one you haven't in a while, or make something unusual with a craft you practice regularly (for instance, if you crochet baby blankets, do amigurumi).\n- **November**: No-Waste November - re-use existing items and create something new!\n- **December**:  [Dismember December](https://habitica.com/challenges/34efc3f1-b20a-4ef3-8a29-5518b0faf123) - Take something apart and make something new with it! That old sweater... unravel it and make a toy. That broken necklace, why not turn it into a matching earring and bracelet! \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Monthly Contest Challenges Rules**\n1. Join the challenge!\n2. Post what you are working on for that month and check off that task. \n3. Give us updates. It helps keep you on track as well as keeping the guild conversation flowing as to what we are all up to. Daily updates are not required, though a few over the month would be ideal. Even \"I have no update\" is totally fine. Life happens and we cannot always stick to what we planned. And that is OK.\n\nYou are not required to participate in any challenge if you do not want to; it's just a fun way to keep us working towards habits as well as bring conversation.\n",

If you have enough knowledge about any of these topics, please feel free to create one!\n\n**More Info:**\n\n- The guild has its own [wiki page](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/The_Keep:Ghost_Ship) (which, sadly, is still very much under construction, but contains some helpful links).\n\n**Guild Name, Guild History, Guild Logo:**\n\n- The guild name has mostly historic reasons: Back in 2014, this guild was found adrift with zero members (which wouldn't be technically possible today). So some early Habitican pirates boarded it and renamed it \"Ghost Ship\". The idea of death-related topics suggested itself - and one of the pirates had wanted to create a \"Become an Organ Donor!\" challenge anyway. The topics of donating blood, stem cells, or even an organ while still alive were also added (because they are so closely related to the topic of after-death organ donation).\n- We are using several different guild logos, and change them occasionally. Suggestions for more logo images are always welcome! The images must be your own art or pictures in the public domain or with a license that allows commercial use.\n\nSo, please feel welcome to haunt this ship!\n\n**Credits & Thanks:**\n\nBig, big thanks (it's a lot of work!) to:\n- **[@Acorn_Sprout](https://habitica.com/profile/2a5618da-d8c4-4530-a943-3fa871ef4859)** who is in charge of the blood donor challenges,\n- **[@Cantras](https://habitica.com/profile/28771972-ca6d-4c03-8261-e1734aa7d21d)** who was in charge of the organ donor challenges for a long time,\n- **[@taiga-lily](https://habitica.com/profile/e1ad5942-fda9-42f8-a5ed-26eb73fcd96b)** who created the challenge [☠️Skull and crossBone Marrow ☠️Join a Stem Cell/Bone Marrow Registry!](https://habitica.com/challenges/55188608-3ed5-45a1-b482-a313e2006229),\n- **[Sasquatch (@webqatch)](https://habitica.com/profile/1912e252-b48a-4b44-b32f-a1c1940f5950)** who created the challenge [Advanced Planning](https://habitica.com/challenges/6b5c29d9-3383-4f8f-b603-277bcbbcce27).\n\n**Search terms:**\n\norgan donation, organ donor, kidney donation, kidney donor, blood donation, blood donor, stem cell donation, stem cell donor, bone marrow donation, bone marrow donor, hair donation, hair donor, wig, volunteering for clinical trials, body donation, body donor, corpse, medical education, medical research, forensic research, death, dying, preparation for death, prepare to die, preparedness, advance healthcare directive, living will, personal directive, advance directive, advance decision, will, testament, intestacy, inheritance, heir, living trust, power of attorney, life insurance, funeral, burial, cremation, obituary, ...",

It can be as small as mailing a letter or making a call... \n\n\n&nbsp;\n---\n\n#### A Frog Field Guide\n*By @Cinnamon Toast and added to by @Lady Moondreamer & @indescribble*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n+ Small :frog: : Has good camouflage. Can hide under tasks that are not frogs, or under larger and more dramatically noticeable frogs, thus evading capture. Consequently often long-lived. Call is a high-pitched \"Oh, but surely you'd rather eat the big frog first.\"\n\n+ Green :frog: : Standard variety, lounges on lily pads just out of reach. Easily identified, but requires some effort to catch. Call is an annoying, twangy \"Aawww, do I have to? But I don't want to!\"\n\n+ Bull :frog: : Larger and tougher than the Green frog, this one lurks ominously atop a rock in the middle of the pond, and will require serious effort to catch. You're going to get muddy. Call is a deep, resonant \"Man, this is the worst!\"\n\n+ Mutant :frog: : A frog of any type that, when grasped, turns out to have extra legs or two heads, making it much more difficult to eat than you had expected. Can be so startling that you drop it, and have to start all over building up the gumption to recapture it.\n\n+ Tree :frog: : With it's bright green body and big red eyes, this frog perches high above making it easy to see but very difficult to catch. Cry is a defeated \"But I'll never reach thaaat!\"\n\n+ Fake :frog: - With a knack for mimicry, this frog gives an impression that it is much larger and more difficult than it appears. Once caught, however, turns out to be quite tame and quick to accomplish. Call is a mimicry of the Bull Frog being a deep, resonant \"Man, this is the worst!\", although once caught, call changes to a friendly \"Why was this hard?\".\n\n+ Poison Dart :frog: - Generally small, bright colored adorable looking frogs that look easy and attractive but when left too long develop a toxic whallup that can take long periods of time to recover from. Call is \"I'm tiny and cute, you can do me later.\" in sweet dulcet tones. *See also Lulufifi's description for the young of this toxic tribe.*\n\n+ Baby Poison Dart :frog: - Tiny, slow-moving and brightly colored, this species sits on the leaves of plants on the shore. It is easy to see and catch, but beware! When caught, it reveals its true nature. What you thought would be easy turns out to be both difficult and painful to handle. Call is a soft, low \"It'll only take five minutes!\"\n\n\n",

Science supports the formation of a healthy routine as beneficial in countless different ways. You can also start as simple as one or two tasks you would like done daily. If you need help developing your routine, see [this attached page.](https://www.northshore.org/healthy-you/how-to-start-a-new-routine-and-stick-to-it/)\n\nI am open for questions as well!\n\nYou may post your routine in the chat for feedback if you feel comfortable to. You are also free to check in and give updates as many times throughout the day as you'd like! We would love to hype up your accomplishments.\n\nAt the end of my \"day\" (around 21:00 CST) I will post a check in that you are encouraged to join. The idea is to reflect on what went well and what we can do better next time.\n\nAs we grow, I also think it would be a cool idea to come up with a reward system we can use as a group. It's important to reward yourself for committing to your mental and physical health after all! Don't be afraid to use the chat if you have suggestions for the guild. I am, after all, aiming to be a participating member myself.\n\nRules:\n1. Anything that goes against [community guidelines](https://habitica.com/static/community-guidelines) will be removed.\n2. Activity is important! We require at least 1 check-in per week to be considered a member.\n3. If you have feedback for someone, always ask first and be kind to one another.\n4. Please do not spam the chat! Habitica can only hold up to 200 messages at once.\n\n**We are not therapists!** If you are struggling with something significant, please refer to [these resources.](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/find-help)\n\n### To join this guild, simply introduce yourself in the chat with your name, pronouns you use, and something you enjoy doing!",

      "description":"## Purpose ##\nMy hope is that we come here with prayer requests and pray. When possible, we should take those prayers and be the hands of God and actively work toward answering them. Encouraging responses in the chat are welcome, but clicking the 'like' button tells everyone that you have prayed over that request or situation.\n\nWe should stand together in our walk with Christ, sharing our successes and failures and encouraging each other. We can share techniques that have helped us out, specific verses, etc. Anyone is welcome to create challenges to encourage members of the guild.\n\n*May God's blessings be upon you and may we be blessings to one another.* \n\n## Resources ##\n[Bible.com](https://www.bible.com/) - The web/computer version of the YouVersion Bible App. The site has over 2,000 versions of the Bible including translations into more than 1,500 languages. The site/app have tools for comparing versions, highlighting, and sharing verses. There is also a system of Bible plans that are created by a wide community of Christian authors to be used as devotionals covering hundreds of topics. Amazingly, this site is ad-free. \n\n[BibleStudyTools.com](https://www.biblestudytools.com/) - Primarily a tool for reading two versions of the Bible side-by-side. This site also has a topic search and Bible commentaries. I was not able to find a clear count of how many versions/languages are available here, but it appears to be over 100. \n\n[OpenBible.info](https://www.openbible.info/) - A topical Bible using the ESV translation. In addition to the robust topic index, there is a tool that links biblical locations to Google Maps so one can visualize the places better. Other tools include a tool that monitors social media for Bible verses and some experimental interfaces for browsing the Bible.\n\n[GotQuestions.org](https://www.gotquestions.org/) - A collection of essays answering thousands of spiritual questions about the Bible. The theology used on this site is non-denominational, but it leans Evangelical, so it may not match everyone's beliefs.\n\n[K-Love](https://www.klove.com/) - A contemporary Christian radio station in the US that has live streaming audio. They have local stations all over the US and partner with some stations in other countries as well. \n\n### On Discord ###\n[The Prayer Room](https://discord.gg/r9QvWYEV) - A Christian Discord community dedicated to fellowship with God and with others. All are welcome, regardless of whether you are a Christian or simply interested in learning about Christianity.\n\n*Anyone that would like to suggest resources for this section should mention them in the chat. I want to keep the guild welcoming to all Christian denominations, so I will try to include only non-denominational resources.*  \n",

      "description":"для подробной информации, а также о других функциях – [Habitica Wiki](https://habitica.fandom.com/ru/wiki/Habitica_Вики). пошаговое руководство – [тут](https://habitica.com/static/overview).  \n### **Привычки, ежедневные задания, задачи (списки внутри задач и ежедневных заданий)**. *В { } будут примеры*.\n\n*Привычки* – сюда лучше всего записывать действия, которые вы будете выполнять более, чем один раз в день. Либо те привычки, от которых вы хотите избавиться/хотите внести в свою жизнь. {не курить} - лучше эту привычку сделать такой, чтобы за нее было наказание и поощрение (+ и -), если вы не курили, то жмете плюс, если покурили, то минус. За каждый нажатый плюс будет награда в виде золота, за каждый минус у персонажа будет отниматься здоровье.\n\n*Ежедневные задания* – действия, которые выполняют один раз в день (ежедневно или по определенным дням, можно регулировать во время создания ежедневного задания). {сделать зарядку, прочитать книгу}\n\n*Задачи* – действия, которые выполняются один раз за все время (можно установить сроки, до какого числа, времени вы должны выполнить ту или иную задачу. также можно установить список, какие действия необходимо сделать для выполнения задачи, со списком награда за выполнение задачи становится больше). {написать курсовую, сдать отчет}\n\n### **Урон по боссу, атака босса, нахождение предметов для квеста в команде**\nЧтобы активировать квест, необходимо присоединиться к существующей команде/создать свою. \nЕсли вы только присоединились к чужой команде, а она уже начала свой квест до того, как вы пришли, то \"войти\" в квест не получится, необходимо подождать, пока команда закончит квест и начнет новый, в котором вы сможете принять участие.\n\n*Урон по боссу* – после того, как вы начали квест, урон боссу будет суммироваться за день (при выполнении привычек/ежедневных заданий/задач), и как только по вашему времени наступит новый день, зайдя в хабитику, просуммированный урон за предыдущий день будет нанесен боссу из квеста.\n \n*Атака босса* – если вы не выполнили какие-то свои ежедневные задания, то вашему персонажу, а также участникам квеста будет нанесен урон. (за привычки и задачи такого нет).\n\n*Нахождение предметов для квеста* – квестовые предметы рандомно находятся при выполнении привычек, ежедневных заданий и задач. \n\n### **Классы, смена класса**\nКласс лучше выбирать по принципу какой стиль игры вам больше нравится. До 10 уровня стандартным классом является *воин*. При достижении 10 уровня у игрока появляется возможность выбрать один из 4 классов: воин, маг, целитель, разбойник. \n\n*Воин* – наносит большой урон по заданиям (уменьшает их красноту). Средняя защита от урона; Может улучшать Телосложение и Силу других игроков; Полезен в боях с боссами и для игроков, у которых много красных заданий. **Слабости** – получает мало опыта. \n\n*Маг* – наносит средний урон по заданиям; Получает много опыта. Может улучшать Интеллект других игроков, восполнять их ману и замораживать серии заданий. **Слабости** – плохое телосложение. \n\n*Целитель* – высокая защита от урона. Может лечить себя и команду. Может улучшать Телосложение других игроков. Полезен в команде в целом и для игроков, у которых много ежедневных заданий. **Слабости** – низкий урон по боссам. \n\n*Разбойник* – находит больше золота и предметов. Выше шанс нанести критический урон, который дает больше золота и опыта. Может улучшать Восприятие других игроков и уворачиваться от урона невыполненных заданий. Полезен в квестах по сбору предметов, для игроков, которые хотят собирать больше предметов, получать больше золота и быстрей улучшать свое снаряжение. **Слабости** – низкий урон по боссам. \n\n***!Внимание!*** после того, как вы выберете свой класс при достижении 10 уровня, сменить его можно будет за *3 самоцвета* в настройках. Либо использовав Шар возрождения (стоимость 6-8 самоцветов). Шар возрождения можно получить бесплатно 1 раз при достижении 100 уровня персонажа (уровень персонажа снижается до первого и возможность смены класса появится, когда вы достигнете 10 уровня). \n\n### **Навыки** \nУ каждого класса есть 4 навыка, которые можно использовать за фиксированное количество маны. Полоска маны появляется при достижении 10 уровня персонажа и выбора одного из классов. Также появляется соответствующая вкладка \"Навыки\" в приложении и на сайте. Чтобы использовать навык, на него необходимо нажать. Навыки направлены на всех членов команды/задачи/на самого героя. Если хочется узнать подробнее о навыках и о том, у какого класса какие навыки, сколько маны стоят, что делают, то жмите – [навыки](https://habitica.fandom.com/ru/wiki/Навыки). Перейдя по ссылке вы найдете необходимую вам информацию, вместе с таблицей навыков. В случае если ссылки не открываются, пишите в гугле \"хабитика вики\", и там ищите нужный раздел. \n\n### **Способы восполнения здоровья** \n• купить во вкладке \"награды\" красное зелье, стоимость 25 монет. (восполняет 15 хп). \n\n• попросить *Целителя* в команде использовать навык/либо же использовать самому, если у вас этот класс. \n\n• апнуть уровень, тогда здоровье персонажа будет заполнено полностью. \n\n• выполнить все ежедневные задания (здоровье не восстановится, но зато вас не атакует босс). *НО*, если вы не одни в команде и кто-то во время квеста не выполнит ежедневку, то вы получите урон, не забывайте об этом. \n\n### **Смерть персонажа** \nПри гибели персонажа хп восстанавливается полностью, но игрок несет следующие потери: \n• Один уровень и весь опыт, который он накопил на пути к следующему уровню\n\n• Одно очко от случайно выбранной характеристики, которое восполняется после получения нового уровня (его нужно будет распределить по-новой)\n\n• Все золото\n\n• Один предмет экипировки текущего класса или общей для всех классов экипировки.\n\n### **Таверна** \nЕсли вы хотите отдохнуть, то можете перейти во вкладку \"таверна\" и нажать кнопку \"остановить урон\", ваш персонаж не будет получать урон за невыполненные вами ежедневные задания, а иконка персонажа перейдет в \"спящий режим\". Когда вы почувствуете, что хотите вернуться и начать выполнять свои задания, то вновь зайдите в таверну и нажмите на кнопку \"вернуться в игру\". \n\n### **Что делать, если случайно нажал на выполнение задания/задачи, не выполнив их в реальной жизни.**\nНаходим кнопку фильтров, выбираем \"все задания\", либо же \"выполненные задачи\", ищем выполненную задачу, она будет серого цвета и нажимаем на нее. После этого она должна стать цвета активной задачи. (за это действие у вас отнимается здоррвье, опыт, мана, золото).\n\n### **Питомцы и скакуны**\nПитомцы и скакуны не дают никаких бонусов, являются только эстетическим элементом игры. Под каждым выведенным питомцем есть шкала зеленого цвета, при заполнении которой *питомец* превращается в *скакуна*. Шкала заполняется, если вы кормите питомца едой. Когда шкала заполнится полностью - питомец превратится в скакуна, а также пропадет из раздела \"питомцы\" (но появится в разделе \"скакуны\"). Можно будет заново вывести питомца с этим же инкубационным эликсиром, но под ним уже не будет зеленой шкалы. Оседлать скакуна можно не только с помощью еды, но и с помощью седла (которое приобретается за самоцветы - донатная валюта, самый быстрый способ). *Чтобы шкала под питомцем заполнялась быстрее, необходимо кормить его едой, которая ему будет нравится, зачастую цвет еды должен совпадать с цветом питомца*. \n\n### **Экипировка, сундук**\nУ каждого класса свое *снаряжение*, которое можно найти во вкладке \"награды\". Если вы видите, что у снаряжения есть замочек, то это означает, что оно сейчас вам недоступно. Сначала необходимо купить снаряжение послабее (без замочка). Также *другое снаряжение* можно получить за выполнение определенных квестов. \n\nИз *сундука* во вкладке \"награды\" (стоимость 100 золотых монет) может выпасть еда, опыт, снаряжение. \n\n### **Как приобрести самоцветы**\nСамоцветы можно получить за: \n\n• победу в испытании (вкладка \"испытания\") \n\n• приобрести подписку (1 самоцвет = 20 золотых монет, но там имеется месячный лимит – 25 самоцветов в месяц). *НО* если вы были непрерывно подписаны 3 месяца подряд или заранее подписались на 3 месяца, то ежемесячный предел покупки самоцветов увеличивается на 5. Предел покупки самоцветов можно максимально увеличить до 50 самоцветов в месяц. \n\n• купить во вкладке \"приобрести самоцветы\" за реальные деньги. \n ___ \n\n[![Laura-s-Illustration-Caroline-Laura-s-tea-break-1.png](https://i.postimg.cc/CLqvQDZ6/Laura-s-Illustration-Caroline-Laura-s-tea-break-1.png)](https://postimg.cc/sv39BM4p)",

So many people quit because they are not sure how to go about learning it. This guild is place you can come to practise your Spanish and ask for feedback or corrections. Believe in yourself.

It is amazing.\n\n[Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) Great for keeping the basics ticking over. Should be used in conjunction with other tools though\n\n[Mundo Primaria](https://www.mundoprimaria.com/) - audio stories, games, poems for Spanish kids but great for learners too!\n\n[Free rice](https://freerice.com/categories/spanish) -  Practice your Spanish whilst donating food to the UN World Food Program, by simply answering the multiple choice vocabulary questions. \n\n[Learn Spanish with Films](https://www.youtube.com/@aprenderespanolconpelicula3644) - a YouTube channel to learn Spanish through short film clips\n\n\n---\n\n\nJust a couple of reminders: \n* Instead of sending lots of short messages please can you group them all together into one long message (you can use the [markdown](http://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Markdown_Cheat_Sheet) to separate the text.) This is because Habitica chat's only hold 200 messages. Combining messages helps older ones stay around longer and lets more people benefit for the chat. Thanks!\n* While things like your name, age, where you live etc are often the first things you learn when learning a new language, the [community guidelines](https://habitica.com/static/community-guidelines) do recommend strongly against: *\"the exchange of personal information -- particularly information that can be used to identify you -- in public chat spaces.\"*\n\n\n---\n\n\n## **Related Habitica Guilds:**\n\n[En español 💬](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/a4cd281d-4683-4604-86f3-d2cc955e1544) - where the native spanish habiticans hang out. \n\n[Duolinguists of Habitica](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/22360759-fd87-444d-86bd-42724be07bd7) - get some duolingo tips\n\n[New Language Learners](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/2817a351-0fd8-4b28-9924-2a15313e69fb) - a Habitica community for learners of any language\n\n[Online Lecture Hall](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/b70e6880-d754-4803-a9a9-f97d0aa9b246) - great for resources related to self teaching\n\n\n\n",

Keep in mind that the Habitica Community Guidelines apply to this meeting room.

Share your own tips and experiences on…\n\n**Being a party leader:** Start your own or join someone else’s group first? What party size is best? What mix of members to have?\n\n**Being a party member:** Do you complete your dailies, contribute scrolls, participate in chat? Are others pulling their weight?\n\n**Recruiting standards:** How do you select applicants? Does your party interview carefully or just let anyone in the door?\n\n**Questing:** How does your party organise questing order? Does everyone use auto-accept scripts (link below) or set deadlines for quest starts?\n\n**Skill buffs:** Do buffs enhance your party or kill the challenge of questing? How many buffs per day is too many?\n\n**Boss damage:** Are your warriors/mages overpowering the party? Do you institute rules so every member gets a chance to strike?\n\n**Handling party conflict:** Should you arbitrate if people start arguing? How to manage a person who gets the party killed? \n\n**Dealing with duds:** What to do with inactive, lazy or non-contributing members? What’s the best policy for constant Inn campers? To kick or not to kick?\n\n**Party motivation:** Are people enthusiastic or listless? Is your party chat healthy, sick or dead? How do I turn a faltering party around? \n\n**Preventing party burnout:** Do members start strong then fade away? Do members share and support each other? Does your group set challenges? \n\n**Stepping down:** When is the right time to move on from a party? What’s the best way to hand over leadership?\n\nIf your party has an issue or you're just curious, ask away! There are some excellent party leaders and members in here who might know an ideal solution.\n\n![FAQ-ribbon](https://i.imgur.com/V3b1J81.png)\n\nAnswers to the most common questions about using the Habitica Party Roster are below.\n\n**Q: \"How do I find a suitable party?\"**\n\n**A:** [CLICK HERE for the Habitica Party Roster main guild](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/808d43d6-58f0-407f-8d1a-5aef11544308) and you'll have no trouble finding a suitable group.\n\n**Q: \"Are you trying to compete with the Party Wanted Guild?\"**\n\n**A:** No. The Habitica Party Roster was created to be an information resource – it’s easy to see all the public guilds, but there was no way to see all the different parties on Habitica.\n\nThe Roster lets people browse and read about all sorts of other parties outside of their own group. As more parties joined they asked to recruit, so the guild description and listing template were altered to accommodate their request. \n\nThe official Party Wanted Guild is a public message board. The Habitica Party Roster is a library database index. While the guilds have some degree of overlap, their basic aims and methods are different.\n\n**Q: \"Why do you insist on only one post per party?\"**\n\n**A:** Guilds are limited to 200 posts so the Roster can only show a maximum of 200 parties at any time. If people start chatting in the main guild (or make multiple posts for their party) it drastically affects how many parties can appear. \n\nWe ask people to please not chat in the main guild, and delete their old party post if they make a new one. Use this meeting room for conversations – your understanding is appreciated. 😀\n\n**Q: \"My party is getting lost under newer parties – what can I do now?\"**\n\n**A:** If you’re concerned you can periodically repost your party once every 2-3 months. Your membership might have changed anyway so updating your party info doesn’t hurt. \n\nReposting bumps your group back to the top of the Roster for best visibility. Please don’t forget to delete your old post afterwards.\n\n**Q: \"How do I display my party logo on Habitica?\"**\n\n**A:** If you have your own website you can link to your hosting. The other alternative is to use an image hosting service such as Flickr or Imgur (links below.) Upload your image and you'll get a share URL to insert in Habitica's markdown code.\n\n**Q: \"How do I add a finished quest to the guild scoreboard?\"**\n\n**A:** [CLICK HERE and send a PM to @NCSUshley](https://habitica.com/profile/919d36e4-5c4f-4ea2-8d3f-08ed2eb786e5) that you have quests to add to the scoreboard. She will then invite you to the scoreboard access area.\n\n**Q: \"I submitted a quest to the scoreboard but it isn't on the board or in the guild news yet. What's up?\"**\n\n**A:** The Party Roster scoreboard and news are updated when time permits. Please be patient – your achievement will appear.\n\n**Q: \"1000 quests for a top scoreboard badge! Why so high?\"**\n\n**A:** Habitica has thousands of existing parties, and brand new parties are formed all the time. The badges highlight the established groups with the dedication and commitment to persevere. If the **🎖500**, **👑750** and **✨🏆✨1000** badges were easy lots of parties could have them.\n\n**Q: \"Can you please make a banner for my party?\"**\n\n**A:** Nope, sorry. The good news is Alex the guild leader at Knights of Academia (KoA) does banners for people. You can find the KoA guild in the links section of the Party Roster main guild.\n\n**Q: \"What's the best way to contact you?\"**\n\n**A:** Asking here in the meeting room is best for general enquiries. Please avoid PMs unless it's urgent or you're requesting an invitation to the scoreboard access area.\n\nEnjoy using the Habitica Party Roster Meeting Room!\n\n---\n**Useful links.**\n\n[Community Guidelines](https://habitica.com/static/community-guidelines) If you don't know the rules, read here.\n\n[Keeping Parties Motivated](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Keeping_Parties_Motivated) Get help from the Habitica Wiki.\n\n[Auto Accept Quest](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Google_Apps_Script#Auto_Accept_Quests) Script for automated accept quests.\n\n[Auto Force Start](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Google_Apps_Script#Auto_Force-Start_Quests) Script for automated quest starts.\n\n[Party & Guild Data Tool](https://oldgods.net/habitica/cTheDragons/group.html) Useful statistics on party activity.\n\n[Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/) / [Imgur](https://imgur.com/) / [Post Image](https://postimages.org/) Image hosting for your party.\n\n[Quest Scoreboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cAT3qpS1Fr9hjlGnVM_vls-pvqevCqYku3hS_Vb_Zbc/edit?usp=sharing) Look at the guild scoreboard.\n\n[Visit Party Roster](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/808d43d6-58f0-407f-8d1a-5aef11544308) Go to the main guild.\n\n[Party Leaders Discussion Guild](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/dc4d8588-486f-4ace-87a5-1517e68217a1) Another guild for party leaders to ask or share advice about running and engaging with a party.\n\n---\nHabitica Party Roster Meeting Room created May 06, 2019 by [-R](https://habitica.com/profile/3807fed9-ada8-41eb-9174-baa26246b57e).

      "description":"You're either fighting to become the best version of yourself, or you are inviting the cancer of mediocrity into your life.  Red Pill over Blue Pill is about accepting the grind of \"the real\", but using all the tricks of psychology and faith to stay in the game, remain consistent, become the best version of yourself, and helping others to do the same.  It's not just a Goal thing, it is about creating a system that leads to a greater Identity.\n\nI highly recommend the book \"Atomic Habits\" as a companion to journeying with this Guild.  It's the best book I've found regarding the Psychology behind habit formation.  \n\nI also recommend prayer.  Self motivation will only take us so far. It is my belief that the real magic of growth, transformation, and overcoming is a spiritual matter.  I believe we will not unlock our truest potential, without faith in a God who can strengthen us to do the seemingly impossible within ourselves. \n\nI love the psychology of habit formation and I love games.  They go together wonderfully.  I am going to try to post encouraging and thought provoking messages from time to time, and I would love for you guys to do the same as we journey together.\n\n-STRLRD\n",

But who also need peer pressure to be productive.\n\nWe have some challenges with habits and dailies that you might find helpful.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWelcome!  The goal of this group is to help working SFF writers with accountability. Part of that comes through challenges and part through the power of peer pressure.\n\nWe also have a [form for people looking to join parties](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1WZsJB3ew_EydGYh3toS6_VATmq82GFw0N6Td63f5pJY/edit?uiv=1#start=embed) AND a [spreadsheet for party leaders](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bVhGkVvrTBJ6_FlymX89KvrV4g6S6R085LahBeX84Zk/edit#gid=406604917) who are looking for new recruits. If you want to join a party, fill out the form, and then announce in the Guild Chat that you have so that party leaders know that there's a new recruit available.\n\n.\n\nAnd if you are looking for someone to write with, [check out the Write Club.](https://www.mywriteclub.com/beta/word-sprints#/Ink%20Slingers)",

Namely: stay on topic, provide content/trigger warnings, and do not start drama/discourse.\n\n### Do not give critique unless it is specifically asked for.  \nNo one likes being criticized out of the blue. If someone is sharing their work, please do not critique them unless they've opened themselves up for critique.\n\n### Keep it PG.  \nFollowing the Community Guidelines, there is to be no NSFW discussion in this guild, from suggestive to explicit. This also means keeping profanity to a minimum.\n\n## Current Challenge: [Writober](https://habitica.com/challenges/09118556-d2a0-4fb0-ad95-e7453f59c1e8).  \nWrite your heart out every day of October with any prompt list you may find or make!

      "description":"[Guild Challenge:: Why Are You or Were You or Do You Want To Be a WARRIOR?]() \nwill start soon to attract new member and run thru January 2019\n\nWINNER Oct-Nov 2018 ***Alexandre Huat***:: *Life is a war for me. I had to fight against so many things in my past, I can't manage in another way. Thinking is a war, doing is a war, feeling is a war. Everywhere I go, I find resistance, and I feel satisfied only when I crushed it down. My approach is kind of extreme, but I hate superficiality. That's why I'm a warrior.*\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Question of the Month - October 2018](https://habitica.com/challenges/ae26c31d-40c1-46aa-a4a0-2a9629a24b5e) Challenge; \n\n### How do you assign your attributes and why? \nWINNER Oct-Nov 2018 ***Ominous***:: *I get all Int so I can maximize the amount of Brutal smashes I can do to bosses and buff players that have more strength than me.*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#### New *Question of the Month* coming soon; this month or next.\nSuggestions for questions would be appreciated. Please PM them to me!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSuggested Questions. Do you have any other questions to add to this one.\n\n. Why do we use ***battle gear*** that is different from our ***costume equipment***?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nYour travels bring you to the Raven's Flask. The fine establishment is one of the finest taverns in the city's central hub. The mood inside is merry and boisterous to put it mildly. A local minstrel plays for the crowd gathered here and sings great tales of adventure.\n\n\n|\n\nPosted just behind the bar keep is a board with a few parchments scrawled with advertisements. One happens to catch your eye. \"Warriors of vast intellect, profound might, and astounding charisma are invited to to join us in The (Arcane?) Warrior's Syndicate.\" it says in bold lettering. the finer print gave directions towards the outskirts of the city limits.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n{help me find a good moniker.\n\nThe Warrior's Hangout - stomping ground - neck of the woods - encampment\n\n***A place Warriors can gather to help each other learn to be the best warriors they can be in habitica.***\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI was given this guild at the end of this month, July. I will start  developing it  soon. \n\nFirst I must choose winners for my many challenges in my other guilds,then modify and improve the challenges to resubmit them for August.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere is a difference between a warrior and a soldier. A soldier is trained to follow orders, to respect authority, and to subjugate their individual thinking process and will to the command hierarchy. A warrior, in contrast, is more autonomous and independent. A warrior engages in battle out of personal choice rather than because of obedience to orders. A warrior is capable of making moral judgments and acting accordingly. A warrior is flexible and adaptable; able to act independently as well as be a team player. A warrior takes responsibility for his or her choices and actions. A warrior is a person of compassion who understands pain and the consequences of action. A warrior understands the horror of war and does not seek it. A warrior understands that glory is only for fools who bask in their own illusions. A warrior, however, when engaged in a righteous cause, fights with such skill, passion, intensity, and brilliance that victory is assured.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\"Syndicate - The word syndicate comes from the French word syndicat which means trade union (syndic meaning administrator), from the Latin word syndicus which in turn comes from the Greek word σύνδικος (syndikos), which means caretaker of an issue --- A syndicate is a self-organizing group of individuals formed to pursue or promote a shared interest.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA place Warriors can gather to help each other learn to be the best warriors they can be in habitica.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNEXT *Question of the Month* CHALLENGE when I start it:: \n\nWhat Battle Gear did you choose and Why? \n",

Post two things you've accomplished or achieved today, and one thing you want to finish or get better at tomorrow. Even if you're feeling down because you've had an unproductive or bad day, find some optimism in reminding yourself what you *did* accomplish, and setting an achievable goal for tomorrow.\n\n\nWhat's the difference between Achieve and Accomplish? Think of \"achieve\" as something you *got* that you worked for - like a good mark on a test, or a promotion, or a nice reference letter, or a compliment you really treasured on your work, that sort of thing. \"Accomplish\" is something you *completed* - like doing the dishes, writing a paper, spending four hours studying a language, taking all the medication you forget. Where you draw the line is up to you, and you can Achieve or Accomplish twice in one day - whatever works!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCongratulations to @AinFach, September/October winner!",

Here you can announce your goal, report your results, and be cheered on by others (or be motivated by the thought of having to admit failure). Struggling with how to get started - or finished - with a project?  \n\nMaybe we can encourage you!  No goal is too small to mention here if you need accountability to help you get it done.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n## ***STAG-talk!***\n\nHere's a handy list if you're ever confused by our unique vocabulary:\n\n**STAGs:** \n\nWe started out as the 'Short Term Goal Accountability Guild' - but when we accidentally  transposed our guild initials, it quickly became what we call the guild and ourselves.  We are the STAGs!\n\n**Badger:** \n\nThe verb means to pester or nag. When we ask other guild members to \"badger\" us to stay on track, they often send cute (animal) badgers to help us out.   *(Because Habitica doesn't have a badger emoji, the friendly pandas :panda_face: have come to our help, and we thank them!)*\n\n**Dr. Meta:** \n\nOriginally from a challenge by @Ryan, \"visiting Dr. Meta\" refers to assessing your Habit setup and tweaking it to make it work better for you. (\"Meta\" as in stepping outside Habit for a moment to view it from a different level.)\n\n-----\n\n### **Poms, pom poms, pomming (:tomato:):** \n\nRelating to the 'Pomodoro' technique:  [Pomodoros](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique .\n\n\n**Clover** (:four_leaf_clover: : four_leaf_clover : ) :\n\nOne clover is equal to at least 100 minutes of work time in a 120 minute time period, for example, 4 consecutive poms.\n\n\n**Hibiscus** ( :hibiscus:  : hibiscus : )  *Hibiscus is a pink flower.* : \n\nUnique to the STAG guild, 1/2 a pom (12 minutes).\n\n\n**Cherries** ( :cherries:  : cherries : ) *note - 'cherries' must be plural.* :\n\nUnique to the STAG guild, 1/4 a pom (4-5 minutes).\n\n-----\n\n**Dolphin** ( :dolphin:  : dolphin : ) :\n\n**'Feeding the dolphin'** refers to getting your dishes done!  Some find their :dolphin: pets prefer to eat once a day, others split their meals into smaller portions.  *But they all get pretty grumpy if not fed!*  They will also eat 'fast food' and take care to remove trash in public places--just not too often!\n\n-----\n\n**DDR** (Deepest Darkest Red) :\n\nThese are your oldest To-Dos!  Time to clip off those red To-Dos that are cluttering up your Task Page!\n\n-----\n\nThe 'Cone of Shame' [see **Cone of Shame:**](http://pbs.twimg.com/media/A_jG9wtCAAIAy5c.jpg:large) :\n\nEscape the dreaded Cone by accomplishing any Tasks of Shame weighing you down. (Do this ONLY if it motivates you!)  *The Cone is not attached to a challenge, just start to wear it at your own choice in the Chat, and let us know what you need to do to 'heal' enough to be rid of it!*\n\n-----\n\nA word on :frog: *(frogs, referencing Mark Twain's concept of doing the unpleasant tasks first when possible)*.  Because several STAGs have sensitivities to this idea, In this guild we gently pat our frogs and they hop away!\"\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n### **STAG sub-guilds**: \n\nLink to the Short Term Goal Accountability OVERFLOW Challenge Chat guild:\n\n# [click here to go to OVERFLOW challenge chat guild](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/dc798b5a-8727-4cb0-962f-9dddf7e7ae39)\n\n\no This guild is for posting perfunctory challenge check-ins, reporting for Badger101/HoneyBadger/GoldenBadger and Dolphin :dolphin: dishes, Hoppy :rabbit2: Hair challenges, and it is also the home of the DFF (Daily Focus Finder) challenges.\n\nWe also have several private STAG sub-guilds for specific topics. \n\n## Ask in the main guild chat for an invite to any that interest you. Any subguild member can invite you!\nSome of them are more active than others, and some have their own additional challenges! \n\n**A Sett Up For Murder and other Nefarious Deeds - A STAG production**  \n\no  This is a fun subguild, where we try to guess what task one of us is doing, i.e., it's a (task) murder mystery guild!\n\n**Mindful STAGs**  \n\no This subguild may be of interest for those practicing mindfulness and meditation.\n\n**The STAG Games Room**  \n\no This is a place to play and find highly gamified and competitive challenges. Virtual board games, anyone?\n\n**Ye Olde STAG Kitchen & Academy of Cookery**  \n\no Many STAGs like to cook and share recipes.  Intended for Instructor and Novice STAG cooks alike.\n\n**STAG Career Center**  \n\no Some STAGs use this for job search encouragement and resources.",

      "description":"# Welcome to the Dopamine Detox Guild!\n\n![Dopamine](https://i.imgur.com/SEoSq2k.jpg)\n\n## Some resources\n\n[Hobby and Activity Ideas - Divided by sensory stimulation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H_G8UlVMbgbXlvhEeNkRp_5m0k9V9bu2CbIdBKcoBlI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n### Important articles that clarify the concept and this guild’s intentions\n\n- [Harvard Health Publishing - Dopamine: The pathway to pleasure](https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/dopamine-the-pathway-to-pleasure) is a short article providing an overview of dopamine. \n\n- [Cell Press, Neuron Review - Pleasure systems in the brain](http://www.kringelbach.org/papers/Neuron_BerridgeKringelbach2015.pdf) is a *long* but very interesting article about how pleasure actually works in the brain. \n\n- [Harvard University - Dopamine, Smartphones, & You: A battle for your time](https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2018/dopamine-smartphones-battle-time/) is a student article about how dopamine is utilised by social media companies to get you to spend as much time on their applications as possible. \n\n- [Harvard Health Publishing - Dopamine fasting: Misunderstanding science spawns a maladaptive fad](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/dopamine-fasting-misunderstanding-science-spawns-a-maladaptive-fad-2020022618917) is a clarification and debunking of “dopamine fasting.”\n\n- [BBC - Is ‘dopamine fasting’ Silicon Valley’s new productivity fad?](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20191115-what-is-dopamine-fasting) is a similar article to the above. \n\n- [PsychCentral - Dopamine Fasting Probably Doesn't Work, Try This Instead](https://psychcentral.com/blog/dopamine-fasting-probably-doesnt-work-try-this-instead) is a similar article to the two above. \n\n- [Compare The Market - Guide to screen addictions and responsible digital use](https://www.comparethemarket.com/broadband/content/screen-usage-guide/) is an extensive guide but digestible guide on how to use your social media responsibly and healthily. There are a list of resources at the bottom of it as well. \n\n- [Center for Humane Technology - Take Control](https://www.humanetech.com/take-control) is a list of steps you can take to limit the effect that your technology has on you and your attention. \n\n***\n\n## The concept\n\nKnown as the “feel good” chemical, a release of dopamine creates feelings of pleasure and reward. Dopamine thus makes the activity that caused its release associated with these positive feelings, encouraging one to continue to perform the activity. This is a good thing, because it is important for us to do things that we enjoy. \n\nHowever, an increase in easy access to content in the digital age has led to a view that our dopamine levels have become skewed. The activities that bring us joy—reading, writing, learning, exercising, etc.—at a higher cost of effort have been neglected in favour of the activities that bring us a cheaper form of joy—social media, gaming, TV, etc. The short term nature of the “dopamine hit” provided by these latter tasks leaves us in a perpetual state of hunger, hence why we may become “addicted” to technology as a source of short-lasting but infinite dopamine hits. Our distraction with these leads to not only a loss of focus on our true passions, but a loss of love for them, as we become increasingly uncomfortable with having to put in too much effort to achieve the same level of dopamine that we could with one click. The problem is, that it is never just *one* click. \n\n***\n\n## The guild\n\nThis guild focuses specifically on moving our sources of dopamine away from the digital world, so that we may return to or creating new hobbies that give us more sustainable and productive enjoyment. \n\nTo anyone who is feeling helpless at their inability to concentrate for long period times (or at all), to anyone who yearns to fall back in love with the activities that once brought them so much joy, to anyone who feels stuck in a mindless cycle of consumption, we welcome you to join this guild! Here, you will find advice on how to undergo your dopamine and/or digital “detox” according to your own goals and state of mind, find support for completing your conquest of dopamine, and ultimately find yourself in a world that constantly tries to distract you. \n\n***\n\n## A PSA\n\nThis guild does not and will not advocate for any extreme form of “dopamine fasting.” Any encouragement of food restriction or enforced social isolation will not be tolerated. The purpose of this guild is to give its members a greater sense of clarity in their life and break out of any negative cycles relating to excessive content consumption, *not* to encourage or give legitimacy to self-harmful behaviours.

It doesn't matter how often, what genders, or your AGAB. \n\n\n•genderflux- a gender identity in which the intensity of your gender changes. This can be paired with other genders, so you can be genderfluidflux, girlflux, non-binaryflux, boyflux, etcetera etcetera\n\n\n•gender fae/doe- a form of genderfluid, but only between feminine and non-binary genders; never masculine (genderfae can to be disrespectful to certain groups, so an alternative is genderdoe)\n\n\n•genderfawn-  a form of genderfluid, but only between masculine and non-binary genders; never feminine\n\n\n•genderflor- a form of genderfluid but only between Non-binary genders; never masculine or feminine \n\n:ocean::ocean::ocean::ocean::ocean::ocean::ocean::ocean::ocean::ocean::ocean::ocean::ocean:\n\n(Definitions of not strictly genderfluid words)\n\n\n•Agender- gender identity that mean that you feel like you don't have a gender (A- means without so Agender means without gender)\n\n•Bigender- gender identity that involves two genders that either mix or the person in question shifts between the two genders. The two genders are typically male and female but they can be any genders.\n\n\n•Xenogender- feeling like your gender is related to something else (I'm sorry that doesn't make v much sense) example: catgender, the person's gender relates to cats in some way (someone give a better definition please I can't do it I'm sorry)\n\n\n•AMAB, AFAB, AND AGAB- Assigned Male At Birth, Assigned Female At Birth, and your Assigned Gender At Birth \n\n\n•Non-Binary- being outside the gender binary. Also a gender in its own right. Also Non-binary is not the same thing as genderfluid, a genderfluid can just use they/them pronouns all the time, and also a genderfluid person can shift between non-binary as one of their genders. However they are not synonymous with each other. (if you want to join a non-binary guild, consider joining \"Non-Binary Pals\")\n\n\n•ADHD- Attention Deficit / Hyperactive Disorder (I noticed a couple of the people here have it including myself, bird, so I thought it would be nice to add it here) \n\n\nIf you think there's a term I missed please tell me\n\n:ocean::ocean::ocean::ocean::ocean::ocean::ocean::ocean::ocean::ocean::ocean::ocean::ocean:\n\nSearch words: gender LGBTQ LGBTQQIP2SAA+ change queer genderqueer fluid flux umbrella presentation questioning enby non-binary trans transgender flag sexuality identity queer\n\n :ocean::ocean::ocean::ocean::ocean::ocean::ocean::ocean::ocean::ocean::ocean::ocean::ocean:\n\nI apologize for the guild summary l can't change it on mobile \n\n :ocean::ocean::ocean::ocean::ocean::ocean::ocean::ocean::ocean::ocean::ocean::ocean::ocean:\n\n:warning: Warning: in this guild we will talk about trans body issues and the like :warning: \n",

      "description":"“The world does not need more Christian literature. What it needs is more Christians writing good literature.” \n--- C. S. Lewis\n\nCurrent guild leader: @Brudesonofthecat\nFounded July 2022\n\nIn the 1930s and 40s, C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien, two of the greatest Christian writers of all times, attended regular meetings with fellow writers and literature enthusiasts. This informal group called themselves the Inklings, and during their time together, they developed some of our most beloved works of fiction. The Chronicles of Narnia, and The Lord of the rings. We dearly hope to continue that legacy in our own humble way here on Habitica.\n\nWe would love to hear about your project or story ideas, whether Christian literature or secular, fiction or nonfiction, poetry or prose, novel or script. We believe Christian writers should write successfully in most genres and use the gifts God has given them to share kingdom principles. We are here to encourage and equip you in any way we can.\n\n\nI started this guild so that we would have a place to discuss and develop our work without the distractions and questionable content that sometimes shows up in the other writing guilds. However, I hope we can all share ownership and care for this guild. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions or concerns, and please share any challenge ideas or useful free resources you can think of to keep us all working and motivated.\n\nOnline resources for Christian Writers:\n\nChristian writing videos by bestselling author Jerry B Jenkins\nhttps://youtube.com/user/NovelistJerryJenkins\n\nList of Christian writer contests\nhttps://blog.reedsy.com/writing-contests/christian/\n\nChristian publications that pay for freelance work\nhttps://christianwritingtoday.com/christian-publications-that-pay-freelance-writers/\n\nChristian Literary Agents\nhttps://christianwritingtoday.com/christian-literary-agents-a-resource-for-christian-writers/\n\nChristian Writer's Market Guide 2022\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Christian-Writers-Market-Guide-Comprehensive/dp/162184207X#:~:text=The%20Christian%20Writers%20Market%20Guide,sell%20whatever%20you%20are%20writing.\n\nGuild Rules:\n\n1.

      "description":"Vi kan komma överens om ordval för att inte begreppen ska skilja sig åt och översättningen blir spretig, diskutera specifika översättningar om det är något som ser konstigt ut och annat som har med översättandet av Habitica att göra.  \n\n\nI regel används svenska skrivregler för översättningarna till svenska, men med vissa undantag.  \n\n+ Habitica och HabiticaRPG ska inte ändras alls. Alltså ingen förändring i versaliseringen eller tillägg av ändelser. Detsamma gäller andra företagsnamn. (t.ex. Take This, Google och GitHub) Använd alltså kamelnotation i de här fallen trots att det bryter mot svenska skrivregler.  \n\n+ Termer med betydelse som är specifik inom Habitica ska versaliseras. Till exempel: Styrka är en karaktärsegenskap och styrka är muskelkraft.  \nOrd som har samma betydelse inom och utanför Habitica inleds som vanligt med gemen. Till exempel har “svärd” samma betydelse oavsett om din karaktär håller i ett svärd eller om du gör det i verkligheten.  \n\n+ För termer som består av två ord inleds bara det första med versal. Exempelvis: \"Magisk kläckningsbrygd\" snarare än \"Magisk Kläckningsbrygd”.  \n\n+ I spelares namn följs den spelarens val av versaler respektive gemener.  \n\n+ Oxfordkomman används i listor, ex. Vanor, Dagliga uppgifter, och Att göra-uppgifter.  \n\n+ Svenskan är i allmänhet ett språk med många sammansättningar och på det sättet nybildning av ord än till exempel engelskan där mycket särskrivs. I våra översättningar blir alltså “Pet Quest Bundle” hellre “Djuruppdragsbunt” snarare än “Djur uppdrags bunt”.  \n\n+ Språkrådet rekommenderar sparsamhet i användningen av bindestreck, vilka bara sätts ut för läsbarhetens skull. Det kan vara för läsaren främmande sammansättningar där det är svårt att särskilja var de självständiga orden börjar och slutar.  \nSammansättningar där uttryck som har flera ord sammanfogas med en efterled kan skrivas med uttrycket-efterled. Till exempel “Att göra” + “uppgifter” = “Att göra-uppgifter” eftersom “Att göra uppgifter” kan tolkas som att “hålla på med att utföra uppgifter”.  \nDetta gäller även namn med flera delar om någon sådan sammansättning behövs i Habitica.  \n\nLänkar:  \n\n[Wiki: Guidance for Linguists](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Guidance_for_Linguists)   \n\n[Wiki: Guidance for Scribes](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Guidance_for_Scribes) (avsnitt 4.4 och 4.5)  \n\n[Wiki: Glossary](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Glossary) (Kan användas för att förstå sammanhangen för orden.) \n",

Any of them may appear as future public challenges, particularly if guild members express a preference.\n\n**Guild description**  \nProcrastination: \"To voluntarily delay an intended course of action despite expecting to be worse-off for the delay.\" (Piers Steel) \n\nDread, shame, regret, anxiety, hopelessness: If you procrastinate, these feelings are probably familiar to you. You may also have thought patterns that keep you stuck: \"I can't do it\". \"I don't feel like it\". \"I'm going to get in trouble for putting this off\". We know procrastination is harmful, yet we do it anyway because it allows us to avoid uncomfortable emotions and thoughts. We \"give in to feel good.\" \n\nThis guild is intended to give Habiticans a place to process these aspects of procrastination and practice skills shown to defeat it. Here, procrastinators can share their success, support others, and receive support. A public commitment to your goals also reduces procrastination, so feel free to state your intentions in the chat thread. \n\nGuild members are expected to follow Habitica's [community guidelines](https://habitica.com/static/community-guidelines). In short, be respectful and don't swear. \n\nProcrastination may be due to psychological or physical issues that should be addressed by a professional. If your procrastination is pervasive, chronic, or has severely diminished your quality of life, consider seeking help from an expert. **This guild is not a substitute for professional help**. \n\n**Some Great Resources**  \n* [Why Procrastinators Procrastinate](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html)\n* [How to Beat Procrastination](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/11/how-to-beat-procrastination.html)\n* [The iProcrastinate podcast](http://iprocrastinate.libsyn.com)\n* [Procrastinus](https://procrastinus.com)",

You can divide topics by line. You can make it by pressing Enter or Shift-Enter once, three underscores (___), and Enter or Shift-Enter again. And it will look like this:**\n___\n# Thank you very much :heart:\n___\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## **USEFUL**\n\nWe tend to overeat or forget about food when we are stressed, anxious. That's why it's good to have an emergancy list. The things in this list can't be harmful to you or to anybody else. It can't be eating, drinking, using drugs etc. you know what I mean. Those things have to make you feel good without fisical or psychological damage. Otherwise, there's no point. Use this list everytime you notice the stress! Ask yourself at least three times a day - how do I feel? 'Cause stress sometimes creeps on you unexpectadly :scream:\nExamples of the things that can calm you down (from our member's lists):\n+ taking a shower or a bath\n+ reading\n+ riding a bicycle\n+ colouring\n+ do a jigsaw puzzle (there are some great websites) listening to a calm music\n+ listen to some calm music with nature sounds, classical (no words)\n+ cleaning, tidying up\n+ sleeping\n+ listening to music\n+ petting or playing with a pet\n+ writing poetry\n+ podcasts\n+ praying\n+ deep, relaxing breathing (many techniques) \n+ exercising\n+ surfing\n+ singing\n+ drinking tea\n+ taking a walk outside\n+ dancing\n+ meditating\n+ playing guitar\n+ cooking\n+ brushing your hair\n+ watch videos of cute animals\n+ watch cartoons\n+ yoga\n+ swimming\n+ squatting\n+ spending time with kids, playing with them\n+ squeeze a squishy ball\n+ spending time with friends\n+ knitting\n+ going for a walk\n+ skin care/foot care, taking care of your  body\n+ sort and rearrange things\n+ doing tasks on Habitica dashboard\n+ listening to a podcast\n+ listen to this [GUIDED MEDITATION: 4 MINUTE STRESS BUSTER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGbEzlMXtX0)\n+ talking to a friend, wife, husband, family\n+ cross stitching\n+ making a list (books, watchlist, any list)\n+ this one's also nice: [Positive Thinking Meditation: Endorphin Meditation with Positive Affirmations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0EQEiecSxs)\n+ listing/writing down what is worrying \n+ having a COLD shower or contrast shower\n+ Try an EFT (tapping) session. Check YouTube for free tapping videos on a variety of issues. Try http://bit.ly/W7yMJG for compulsive eating.\n+ sensory awareness/body scan\n+  massaging ears\n+ restorative yoga\n+ visualization/meditation (for example https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a747iJ5uVlY Its not really about weight loss despite the title, it is about seeing yourself as healthy, beautiful and loved)\n+ drinking water\n+ Hug yourself or put your heands on your heart or whatever feels better and say: \"I love myself, I care about myself and my body, I am healthy, strong and beautifull.\" Repeat it several times. If you want you can also try it in front of the mirror.\n\n\nAnd here's a mantra from one of our members, tarnishedviolet, if you're stressed out and want to eat: \"This will pass, this is the decision you have to make everyday if you want to reach your goals. You have to decide that giving up that momentary comfort is far easier than waiting longer than needed to reach your goal. You can do this, you are doing this. Now go get some water ❤️💕\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd some words from me, Transurfer 🏄, in case you are on the verge of complete breakdown:  Stay strong! Everyone has been there. The most important thing is to truly understand that it's TEMPORARY. However bad everything looks now, it is TEMPORARY. sit down, breath deep and understand that. Relax.

[That Sugar Film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-ZssAn8lSM)\n\nVeganValerie: Make things easier on yourself by removing the binge food from your environment. Don't bring it into your home, your car, wherever you are. Its easy to cram crackers and cinnabon but hard to binge on high fiber foods like broccoli and carrots and baked potatoes. You don't need any willpower to eat what isn't there. So take heart, and then take those troubling foods and dump them outside in the dumpster. What a relief! You've got this! If you want to learn more about this read the book The Pleasure Trap by Alan Goldhamer and Doug Lisle. Also you can go to YouTube and watch Chef AJ channel Weight Loss Wednesday videos. Great resources! \n\nAnd even if you have  troubling food waiting for you in the office or at home you can still minimize your interaction with it. Express your serious struggles and your health goals to your family and friends/coworkers and solicit their help. They may surprise you! They may even have similar goals and want to work together with you to eliminate the offending foods. Ask for your own separate area to store your food apart from others, a simple cupboard or your own mini fridge may do. You an also by a locked food safe. They sell them on Amazon. Some are even opaque so you can't see what's inside. Let your family have the key and then you can't get into it. Buy a bottle of quality essential oil of clove--when you feel overwhelmed by temptation put a drop of oil in a small cup of water and swish it in your mouth. Spit it out. It is very strong and kind of numbing so you won't be able to eat for an hour after you use the oil. Also, make the decision that your housemates/friends food is not yours to eat. Only eat the food you buy, and then make those choices at the grocery store good ones so that all you've got surrounding you is healthy yumminess! You know what else helps: make a vision board of pictures and words and images that remind and inspire you why you don't want to binge or eat crap. Take a photo and make it your phone wallpaper so that you always have it with you and can look at it before you give way to junk food cravings. Commit to taking the very best care of yourself, show yourself compassion and lovingkindness. You are empowered individuals and can have the health and body you want and deserve! I have honestly learned so much from my health coach Chef AJ. Look her up on YouTube and Facebook and just start watching and enjoying her multitudes of free materials. You've got this!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nVeganValerie: I respectfully disagree with the statement \"moderation in all things.\" Moderation in smoking? Moderation in drugs?... Moderation of vices does not serve us well. Moderation in good things is the context in which this mantra should be applied. For instance: if all you do is eat raisins, maybe you need to incorporate some other fruit into your meals. Or say you like running for exercise every day but you don't want to suffer a repetitive injury so you swap some days for cycling or swimming instead. Stuff like that--good-for-you things done with moderation. Don't use the saying to justify partaking in harmful things, like sugar and processed \"food,\" or you may forever cheat yourself out of the health and body you deserve. (I suggest whole dates if you want something super sweet!) The things that are bad for our health will never be good for us, they may be \"less bad\" than other things but that does not make them good. And since this guild has an aim at addressing addictive eating patterns, being called Compulsive Overeaters, I think it's worth considering this: when has moderation ever worked for an addict? Telling an alcoholic to just push themselves away from the bar isn't a very effective strategy; or suggesting changing from hard liquor to light beer?? It doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Abstinence is the key to success. Similarly, those struggling with addiction to processed food would be better served to stop tempting themselves with morsels of this and that but rather learn to find pleasure in other foods that do not trigger them to overeat. Vegetables and whole grains and potatoes are wonderful wholesome foods that you can't overeat on easily because of the high water and fiber content-- You get full before you can overdo the calories, (unlike with cookies or chips or crackers where you can eat through a whole bag before you know it.) This all might sound austere but you can live a fine and happy and healthy life without sugar and dairy and junk food. If you could have moderated your weight and food intake you would have long ago, so instead of trying another moderation diet to lose the same 20 pounds year after year, just treat the offending foods the way a sober alcoholic treats a drink: say no, and keep your environment clear of them. Learn to love the foods that love you back, focus on them, and you will find the peace and the good health that you deserve. (Well, that was long. If you read the whole thing give yourself an emphatic pat on the back!)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n:surfer: If someone has troubles of quitting or reducing amount of soft drinks they consume, here's an idea: get a concentrated apple juice (it's just juice and nothing else, I've found it in an ecological shop) and mix it with sparkling mineral water. Yummy! Tastes like apple cider without anything bad in it. just juice and water. You can also experiment with other things and sparkling water. For example I used to squeeze an orange juice and then mix it with sparkling water and got fanta XD\n\n&nbsp;\n\nVeganValerie: I think we should not weigh ourselfs on the scale and instead focus on eating healthy and getting some exercise. The scale only tells you your relationship with earth's gravity. It does not measure your ratio of fat to muscle or bone or stool or water or any of the other components of your body. When we stop to think about it, people don't really want to lose weight, (we can lop off a limb if that were the case,) people want to lose fat and the scale doesn't tell us that. Additionally, working out often makes people gain weight so the people who choose to measure their progress with the scale feel like they are failing, but they are not failing; muscle weighs more than fat but is much more attractive than fat; it even helps burn fat! But the scale doesn't differentiate any of this. The scale really isn't a useful tool at all except to emotionally upset oneself. I like mesauring my success based on daily healthy actions that I can take consistently like \"eat a green salad\" and \"have veggies first for breakfast\" and \"reach my pedometer goal\" and \"skip on refined sugar,\" etc. I check them off each night and feel really good about my progress, unlike waiting for the scale to give me some arbitrary low number. My weight does not define me, but my daily actions do. Yes, ditch the scale. You can always have your doctor weigh you at your next appointment if you want. Sending you lots of encouragement!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n:free: There are a lot of things without sugar!  but you'll have to cook. They put sugar almost in all prepared food. My advice is to go and invastigate in your favorite shop and maybe in some others. Sometimes there is stuff, you just have to look for it. An then you have veggies, fruits, grains, meat, fish, paultry, eggs, nuts, beans, dairy, seafood.. I've just googled and came up with this [\"No Sugar\" Shopping List](http://www.sparkpeople.com/mypage_public_journal_individual.asp?blog_id=698044)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nap_bookish: Hi All. A few people have been asking themselves, \"Why do I do things that aren't in my best interest?\" The book \"The Secret Life of Fat\" by Dr Sylvia Tara gives some cognitive, psychological, and physical reasons why so many of us persist in doing what we really don't want to do. I've found that knowing what's behind self-sabotage helps me prevent it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSummra: When offered a food in the office/a party/what have you, immediately put half of it away. Like, if I am taking chips, I put half of them in a plastic baggie I keep in my purse for a later time. I have been finding in the majority of cases I don't think about my leftovers until the next day!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nRaptorSLH: For me, the question wouldn't be \"Should I indulge?\" it's \"I'm going to indulge soon. How can I do that without going overboard?\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\n daisy783 : I have always been a fan of cooking more and refrigerating or freezing it for another day but for the first time this week, I cooked meals for the whole week (lunch and dinner). This was a lot of work, planning and prepping for 2.5 hours on Sunday evening, but so far it has been really good during the week. Now I don't have to think about what I want or feel like to eat, and a home-cooked healthy meal option is always ready for me. This has even helped me exercise this week: as I don't need time to prepare something to eat, I have been able to fit a short workout (only 20-30 min or so) in after work every day so far! This week, I attempted it using a Meal-Prepping cookbook, but I think in the future I will plan it using my own recipes (they tend to be a bit simpler than the recipe book so I'm hoping to save some time). The book also had snacks planed for each day (fruit salad, yogurt and fruit, hard-boiled egg with tomatoes) which I think I will adapt into an apple, an orange etc. (i.e. foods that don't need prepping also to cut down the prepping time on sundays). As nice as it is to have a nice fruit salad in the afternoon, I think cutting up a bunch of fruit for the whole week is too much work to make this thing sustainable for me in the long run. It is not that difficult to prepare a bunch of stir-fry veggies, cook rice in bulk, or make a big pot of vegetable soup that can be reheated quickly and combine different components for a variety of meals throughout the week, so I think I will try this next. But not having to think about any of my food choices throughout the day has made this week infinately much more relaxed for me. I am beginning to realize how much just thinking about what I want, can or cannot eat has been on my mind. Sorry for the long post, and maybe this is not new to many of you, but I just wanted to share my experiences as it has been quite eye-opening for me! Thanks everybody!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nImcarpe: You cannot take care of ANYONE else if you don't take care of YOURSELF first - they need you at your best, and you can't be your best if you don't take at least a few moments to take care of yourself. It is not selfish to take care of yourself either (that's how I always feel) because the better you are and the better you feel, the more patient, caring, compassionate, understanding, and helpful you can be to those who need you. If you want to give then the very best of you, then be the very best you by taking care of yourself!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTransurfer🏄: Think about your body,.. think about your liver, pancreas, intestins, stomach... they are fighting every day with the junk we eat to give us more days to live.",

My name is shown in the top left under \"Gretchen's Obligers\" next to \"Group Leader\"**\n\nThe main purpose of this guild is to make it easier for Obligers to get into an Obliger party. The Habitica Parties provide us the additional accountability we need.\n\nObligers are one of four tendencies described in Gretchen Rubin's book, **\"The Four Tendencies\"**. \n\nTo identify your Tendency -- to find out whether you're an Upholder, Questioner, Obliger, or Rebel -- take the free quiz. It is quick and easy to find out your motivational tendency via her short profiler: https://gretchenrubin.com/books/the-four-tendencies/take-the-quiz/\n\nAn Obliger's best strategy for success is to be accountable to others. I have had little success over the years finding reliable accountability partners. I realized that a Habitica party would be an excellent resource for this. I have already joined several Habitica Guilds that are somewhat related – but not as powerful as a Habitica Party.\n\nThe book \"The Four Tendencies\", by Gretchen Rubin has been very beneficial for me. It explains how we all have preferences for what motivates us - external and/or internal expectations. Many of us struggle because we try to change our nature (our tendencies) which is nearly impossible. Instead, understand your motivational tendencies and have strategies for working successfully. It can also help you understand and work better with others when you appreciate their preferences.\n\nWhat are \"The Four Tendencies\"?\n\nAccording to Gretchen Rubin,\n*\"...(W)e all face two kinds of expectations:\n•    outer expectations—expectations others place on us, like meeting a work deadline\n•    inner expectations—expectations we place on ourselves, like keeping a New Year's resolution\n\nAnd here was my crucial insight: Depending on a person's response to outer and inner expectations, that person falls into one of four distinct types:\n\nUpholders respond readily to both outer expectations and inner expectations\n\nQuestioners question all expectations; they meet an expectation only if they believe it's\njustified, so in effect they respond only to inner expectations\n\nObligers respond readily to outer expectations but struggle to meet inner expectations\n\nRebels resist all expectations, outer and inner alike.*",

We share our best moments in the classroom, and our not-so-best. Here, we can post resources, hold each other accountable, and talk about how to be an effective teacher. Look below to find some resources for classroom and time management, strategies for effective teaching, and how to promote active learning. If you have any other resources, post them in the guild chat and they'll be added to the list!\n\nWelcome. Please, talk to us!\n\n# Resources\n\nMore will be posted here as it comes. When I have time, I'll try to organize it a little better! Please share some resources with us!\n\n### Top Ten Teaching Strategies (taken from Poorvu Center for Teaching and Learning)\n\n1. Learn every student's name.\n1. Create course objectives and classroom policies as a way to begin establishing a community, and review them at midterm or more, as needed. In addition, discuss each session's learning objectives in class, with each meeting. Being explicit about your pedagogical techniques helps students see the design behind their learning.\n1. Identify and utilize your pedagogical strengths and develop your teaching weaknesses.\n1. From the beginning, practice strictness as a matter of policy and grace as a matter of humanity. Be yourself -- let students see who you are.\n1.  Create classroom spaces in which everyone feels encouraged to participate. Be willing to learn about and use inclusive teaching practices in order to make belonging a reality.\n1. Punctuate or inform the journey through course content with \"big questions\" and \"big issues\" that grapple with truth and the nature of the absolute.\n1. Assign frequent, lower stakes assignments as a way to help students measure their learning progress. Give meaningful feedback on each assignment.\n1. Use a midterm course evaluation to garner feedback and improve the course.\n1. Be willing to put a lesson plan aside if students really want or need to talk about something, like a campus incident or a national event.\n1. Remember first, last, and in between, that you are teaching people, not the subject. Take every opportunity to show students you care about them as people and about their learning.\n\n### Some resources for effective teaching strategies (from Yale)\n\n* [https://poorvucenter.yale.edu/FacultyResources/Teaching-Strategies](https://poorvucenter.yale.edu/FacultyResources/Teaching-Strategies)\n\n### Inclusivity in the classroom (from Yale)\n\n* [https://ctl.yale.edu/sites/default/files/basic-page-supplementary-materials-files/inclusive_classroom_climate_handout_0.pdf](https://ctl.yale.edu/sites/default/files/basic-page-supplementary-materials-files/inclusive_classroom_climate_handout_0.pdf)\n* [https://ctl.yale.edu/sites/default/files/basic-page-supplementary-materials-files/inclusive_teaching_strategies_handout_0.pdf](https://ctl.yale.edu/sites/default/files/basic-page-supplementary-materials-files/inclusive_teaching_strategies_handout_0.pdf)\n\n### Organizing your class\n\n* https://poorvucenter.yale.edu/OrganizingYourCourse\n",

Please put slashes like this // when talking out of character, and quotations like this \"\" when your oc is talking. Try not to spoil any of the books.\n\n**Roleplay Rules:**\n\nDo not take control of someone else's character without their permission \n\nAbsolutely NO violence\n\nNo swearing (I'm pretty sure \"Three Moons\" doesn't count) \n\nAll powers and tribes allowed, including fantribes\n\nYou can have 1-3 oc's that you roleplay as\n\n\n**Characters:**\n\n[@ravenpaw_](https://habitica.com/profile/704e399c-a9a9-4c55-b4eb-a90bf4e6c0f8):Aurora\n\nSilk wing-night wing-ice wing hybrid, she was just a Silk wing-Night wing hybrid, but an ice wing animus came across this funny looking egg in the middle of the forest, and took care of it, somehow accidentally making it a part Ice wing animus too! loyal to the silk wings, ice wings and night wings. She's a good builder, can fight well--she may be skinny but she has muscles. Abilities: Can do mind reading, but it's not as strong as Moon's, sometimes only able to read some emotions; frostbreath(slightly harder for her than fire); fire breathing; animus powers, flamesilk. She has one lavender eye and one aqua blue eye. Her name comes from the ice wing animus, as her parents were nowhere to be found when she was only an egg.\n\n(other OC) Night has black primary scales, with a little gray to it. She has dark blue secondary scales, and piercing ice-blue eyes. Night has some glowing scales, and see https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wings-of-fire-fanon-tribes/images/8/8b/Screenshot_2021-04-01_10.41.40_AM.png/revision/latest?cb=20210401144601 for how glowing stripes are like (I didn't draw it, it is from fandom https://wings-of-fire-fanon-tribes.fandom.com/wiki/PitchWings Night is also half Deep Dwelling Squidwing (https://wings-of-fire-fanon-tribes.fandom.com/wiki/SquidWings also not my created fantribe), and the Squidwing appeareance is only wavy fins grown along her wrists and thick webbing between her claws and the morphing cells she has. (Night's parents met in a weird way. Her mother was digging deep down to find a good cave, and accidentally dug into the deep sea. Her father saw her mother and saved her.) Abilities: As part Pitchwing, Night has super good night vision; She has icy black breath that can give a dragon frostbite, but if the dragon is an icewing it would not affect the dragon that much; Glowing Scale FLASH! Basically Night just flashes her scales SUPER bright so it either temporarily blinds the dragon or peramently blinds the dragon; Being part Squidwing the morphing cells Night has can help her camoflague, and after some more years of practice she can generate(its generate instead of \"possesses layer-like scales all over their body and snout\", because she's hybrid) \"fake scales\" to look like dragons from other tribes! \nPitchwings have black primary scales. It can have some grey to it, but not much. They usually have fin-like things on their head to their back. They have dark grey, dark purple or dark blue secondary scales. They also have wave-like designs on their fins to show if their royal or not. For their underbelly and head color the colors usually are either dark blue, dark purple, or dark pink. They have medium sized wings and obsidian black wings. Pitchwings have icy black frostbreath, but it doesn’t work against Icewings. They have night vision and some scales glow. \n\n[@Bunny8000](https://habitica.com/profile/12298810-8149-481c-b0f4-22a05637bfce)\nJewel is a 4 year old rainwing who is smart, hot-tempered, paranoid, and clever.\nHas a pet sloth named Pineapple. When not changing scale color, scales are usually indigo and gold.\nJewel was born in the rainforest, but decided to leave because she was bored there. She flew towards the lost continent (without knowing it, of course) and ended up there. No dragon there knows she's there, and she's been hiding to try and overhear dragons and find out things about Pantala. She's been there for three months.\n\n[@DRAGON_MASTER13](https://habitica.com/profile/8e8de7a3-1ae2-472e-944b-1acc354a7f31): Molten was born on a small island off the coast of the forest kingdom for 4 years. Then the war came. He and his family rushed to Pyriiha. He lost a horn in the process. Then, when they got there, they were separated.\n\n[@THE_REAL_GLADoS](https://habitica.com/profile/170a39e0-5e30-4735-9419-a496bdc90e71): Name: Link  Age: 4 Personality: Trusting, kind, curious, brave. Type of Dragon: Skywing/Highwing Link was born in the kingdom of the stars, and was born as a flamescales, and a storm Animus. His family was divided when the great war of Sandwing succession and his father and mother were killed. He is Gold colored, and glitters like the night sky. Link is from the kingdom of the stars. He is a very special dragon, because of the powers he has. He is a star child and is able to manipulate star matter. He also needs star matter to survive. He loved another star child, Star seeker. Then the inkwings and shadowwings came, overthrew the kingdom, and in a battle, sent link falling to his doom, his starmatter wings torn off.\n\n [@Xx1Ash1xX](https://habitica.com/profile/0323b9b9-4a6a-4774-804e-693ff7d8c038): Darkstar is a night-wing who likes to keep to herself. She's mostly a follower, but if she has to lead, she will. She's strong, athletic and good as an assassin build (obviously, there will be none of that tho). She was on the run (fly?) and landed on a small island to rest. After that, she saw a really weird continent. She took a break from flying and landed on a beach\n\n[@Bethany_T](https://habitica.com/profile/ab439d60-52be-4e80-947f-68e7b3ce9391): Daybreak is a female SunWing dragonet about 6 years old. SunWings are medium-sized yellow, gold, or light orange (rarely blue or red) dragons with a few color changing scales scattered on them called \"Emberscales\" (they change color from gold to orange to red) who are fireproof, can breathe fire, can blast a beam of damaging sunlight out of their mouths, and when they have not been exposed to direct sunlight for about three days in a row, they turn dark red, can't use their sunlight attack, spit lava whenever they try to breathe fire, lose their fireproofness, and their emberscales stop glowing (normally they glow slightly). Daybreak is mostly orangish-gold but has a rare color variant where eyes are bluish-purple and her wings and underbelly are a light purplish color that fades to deep blue at the edge.\n\n[@Max_he_him](https://habitica.com/profile/47265c3c-5156-4125-85f0-7721f6f333d3): my name is Black Hawk and I'm a Skywing Nightwing Breezewing hybrid, I'm a female. I can be mean to people I don't know, but I'm nice when you get to know me, I hatched 20 years ago, so I'm kinda young. But I'm more mature than I look/sound. I'm a dark red with black scale accents, and I have glowing scales.\n\n[@ldentity](https://habitica.com/profile/120700b6-e50f-45c4-b468-f2ad1963a175): Bone is a Moon creature, and she was banished from the moon because she failed in her training and was sent to earth on a meteor. She is a white dragon with a spike shaped earring(made from bone) and she fades from white  to gold, which is a weird variant of color that is closer to albino sunwings(https://artfiles.alphacoders.com/133/thumb-1920-133371.jpg) (not as creepy and strong as that dragon in teh pic but the coloring of the dragon is right). Her eyes are pure gold with flecks of sky-blue. As Moon creatures are a descendant of Sunwings, they have color changing eyes but the colors are limited to blue red black and white. Her species has always been somehow at war with...some species call SunWings, but she always thought that the Moon creatures(also named as Lunars)  are the cruel ones. She can teleport a medium distance by dissolving and re-forming her essence, and she breathes out two kinds of flames: One is a pure white flame, that is cold to the bone and extinguish any heat(Lunars' body heat is minus degrees lol), and the other is a seemingly friendly flame that sparkles, but can take the soul of a dragon(and the dragon with no soul would turn into a new-born scavenger with no memories of the past on a random place in the world). As a unique variation(once in one thousand years a new variation would be born, she can gather the pure essence of the moon to form a dome that can bounce anything back some meters if they/it attempt/attempts to enter or break the dome(takes a little bit of energy), or use a lot of energy that will drain them after three times in a row to use the pure essence of the moon into a huge tornado and blast at the enemies. Lunars need the moon as much as Sunwings need the sun or star childs need the star, and they will lose their powers over the moon and their flames will have a chance to come out as stones from the moon. They fall into a deep slumber if they don't get any moonlight after six days and if after a week in their slumber they still do not receive moonlight they might turn into a star(its not rrly proven as only once happened).\n\n[@DragonDM38](https://habitica.com/profile/a2c7836e-8004-47e5-9756-01b3c3284221): A mudwing named Swiftwing\n\n[@BattleOfTheWarwings](https://habitica.com/profile/0dbab764-1882-4a7e-91ed-93dc60d505ea): Discharge is a four and a half year old dragonet. He was animus touched when he was an egg by an IceWing along with some other eggs. Discharge was originally a NightWing, but is now what can be called a ThunderWing. There were many so called ThunderWings, as experiments, at first; but now Tornado is the last one. He has dark purple scales, lighter purple for the inside of his wings, with lightning-shaped strikes of yellow scales on the underside of her wings. Discharge can breathe lightning, as a ThunderWing. However, Tornado doesn't know anything about his past, except the fact that he looks different from other NightWings, and assumes he's a hybrid. He ran away from the NightWings to just flounder around wherever. Discharge is very bouncy and energetic, and a bit naive. He's a pro at being a clingy, whiny dragonet or an annoying talks-too-much dragon, but may or may not be good company.\n\n(other OC): An Icewing animus named Rime. \n\n[@Nyxnyxapocalypse](https://habitica.com/profile/99f64147-aacc-4288-b0bb-9317fb8f614a):\n\nA rain-icewing named Silverstone, she's Glory's niece\n\n[@ameliaofpotts](https://habitica.com/profile/27f0b529-1d2a-4077-8665-1c83443e74f4):\n\nShadowcreeper, a shy female full Nightwing who is also a strong mindreader and future seer. She is full black with purple eyes. She is incredibly loyal and trustworthy. \n\n[@stardewfire1](https://habitica.com/profile/a1da48a2-2cff-4162-8af6-6e88d3772190): \n\nA Skywing named Ember.

Add your character to the roleplay by figuring out a backstory!  \nThe best way to create a backstory without disrupting the roleplay is typically to either have your cat be a rogue/kittypet gone wild/ lost cat.

      "description":"CPTSD (complex post-traumatic stress disorder) = PTSD + DSO. CPTSD is usually is a result of repeated trauma.\n\nDSO ('disturbances in self-organization') = affective dysregulation + **negative self-concept** + disturbances in relationships\n\nPTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) =  re-experiencing + avoidance + sense of threat \n\n\"**Negative self-concept** symptoms are central to CPTSD and are deﬁned in terms of persistent\nbeliefs about oneself as diminished, defeated or worthless, and are accompanied by deep and\npervasive feelings of shame, guilt or failure [Maercker et al., 2013](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328030427_Is_Self-Compassion_a_Worthwhile_Therapeutic_Target_for_ICD-11_Complex_PTSD_CPTSD)\"\n\n**Self-compassion** can help battle **negative self-concept** (see sources below)\n\n_________\n\n## **Our vision for this guild:**\n\n- It is a place to exchange resources, information about CPTSD, and ideas about effective self-care\n- It is a place to talk about your own experience with therapy\n- It is a place to discuss ways of creating and protecting healthy boundaries\n- It is a place to share personal thoughts, reality and struggles. But with the goal to create supportive involvement and participation, to give a positive outer perspective on the own situation.\n- It is to help us get better and help each other get better.\n\n_________\n\n## **Rules of this guild:**\n\n- What is written here, what is read here, let it stay here\n\n- Anyone can create challenges\n\n- Be respectful and kind to each other\n\n- Avoid polarizing topics like religion and politics\n\n- No self promotion\n\n- **Avoid/minimize triggers.** (Don't go into details of abuse/trauma, as little detail as possible). I hope this will be the place that helps get out of bad situation and heal, not re-traumatize ourselves again.\n\n- **This guild is not a “substitute for a therapy”**\n\n- **This guild is not a place for nonconstructive venting.**\n\n- Apart from triggers, **please, let me or moderators know if there's some post in the guild that can be dangerous to someone in a vulnerable state.** Please let us all assume the responsibility of protecting those who are most vulnerable of us or are currently in a vulnerable state\n\nWhat can be considered triggering:\n- description of the events that lead to traumatization or even CPTSD. You can name what it was, just don't go into details. \n- suicidal ideations \n- elaboration on harming self or others\n- elaboration on some unhealthy coping methods such as addictions\n- describing any graphic and/or violent scenes\n\nWhat can be considered dangerous topics:\n- suicidal ideations \n- elaboration on harming self or others\n\n\nFeel free to write to me or in the chat if you think that it's better to change the definition of what's triggering so that we could still have a constructive conversation (or a pleasant chat) and not get triggered.\n\nAnd maybe let's try to keep it light here, not to make this guild to be the place for grieving. I know that grieving is important but all of us have some heavy stuff in our past. All of us have many challenges in our life. Just let's try to not make each other sad here. I hope you have another good place to vent and someone who will be able to compassionately listen about heavy stuff when you need to talk about it, but this is not the place for that.\n\nIt does not help when stuff gets 'dumped' or empathy gets 'extracted'. It’s not a place to pour out traumatic things, without any kind of reflection about how others may feel reading it. It just takes all the emotional space, leaving no room for others. Plus, this brings other members in an uncomfortable place, where you don’t know what to say to improve their situation. And I guess that most of us feel really sorry about it because we all know how much it hurts and can relate to the suffering due to our own experiences - even if it’s not the same experience. But this feeling of powerlessness and helplessness in regard to others (beside the fact that probably many of us have it daily about themselves) is what triggers.\n\nMany thanks to all who gave their feedback on their vision and rules for the guild @LaMamaFox, @Suchermaus, @Acylon, @sophievdm, @Citizen_of_Elantis.\n\nHave your own ideas on what you’d like to see and what you wouldn’t like to see in this guild? Please let us know!\n\n_____________\n_____________\n## **If you are having a panic attack**, meditation is probably more beneficial then the steps from below [Panic Disorder... What is it?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aDglTzfNpM)\n\n\n\n\n\n## :sunny: **But when you FREEZE** you can do all or some of the steps provided below until you feel better: \n\n**1.**  Say to yourself, I am having a flashback. The past memories cannot hurt you now, although you may feel helpless, hopeless and surrounded by danger. Remind yourself: I feel afraid but I am not in danger. I am safe now. The past is the past.\n\n**2.** Own your right/need to have boundaries. You don’t have to allow anyone to mistreat you. You are free to leave dangerous situations and protest unfair behavior.\n\n**3.** Speak reassuringly to the inner child. The child needs to know that you love her/him unconditionally.\n\n**4.** Deconstruct eternity thinking. Fear and abandonment felt endless—remember this flashback will pass as it always has before.\n\n**5.** Remind yourself that you are in an adult body. You have allies, skills and resources to protect you that you never had as a child.\n\n**6.** Ease back into your body. Fear launches you into heady worrying, or numbing and spacing out. (Gently ask your body to relax, breathe deeply and slowly, slow down, find a safe place (blanket or hold a pillow), feel the fear without reacting to it\n\n**7.** Resist the inner critic’s drasticizing and catastrophizing. Use thought stopping to have the critic’s constant planning, and endless exaggerations of danger, or self shame. Use thought substitution and thought correction to replace negative thinking with a memorized list of your qualities and accomplishments.\n\n**8.** Allow yourself to grieve. Flashbacks are opportunities to release old, unexpressed feelings of fear, hurt, and abandonment. Validate and soothe your child’s past experience of helplessness and hopelessness. Grieving can turn tears into self-compassion and anger into self-protection.\n\n**9.** Cultivate safe relationships and seek support.\n\n**10.** Learn to identify the types of triggers that lead to flashbacks. Avoid unsafe people, places, activities, and triggering mental processes. Practice preventive maintenance with these steps when triggering situations are unavoidable.\n\n**11.** Figure out what you are flashing back to. Flashbacks are opportunities to discover, validate and heal your wounds from past abuse and abandonment. They also point to your still unmet developmental needs and can provide you with the motivation to get them met.\n\n**12.** Be patient with a slow recovery process. It takes time in the present to become de-adrenalized and considerable time in the future to gradually decrease the intensity, duration, and frequency of flashbacks. Real recovery is often 2 steps forward and one back—it’s not an attained finish line.\n\nFrom Pete Walker.\n\n_____________\n\n**Definitions:**\n\n\"The core criteria for PTSD\ncomprises first: re-experiencing the traumatic event in the\npresent for instance in the form of flashbacks intrusions\nthat were experienced during the traumatic event. Second:\nThe presence of avoidance of thoughts, memories or\nplaces related to the event. Third and last the presence of\npersistent perceptions of heightened current threat, for in-\nstance hypervigilance. The symptoms must persist for at\nleast several weeks and cause significant impairment in\nimportant areas of functioning [19]. Additional to the de-\nscribed symptom clusters, CPTSD diagnosis requires the\npresence of three further symptom clusters. Those three\nclusters described in the literature as symptoms of distur-\nbances in self-organization (DSO) [1,7,9,20–22]. The\nclusters are as follows: First, symptoms of affective dysreg-\nulation. For instance, difficulties in handling emotional\noutbursts or depressive symptoms. Second, symptoms\nconcerning a negative self-concept, such as feelings of\nsever shame or severe guilt related to the traumatic event.\nThird, symptoms of problems in interpersonal relation-\nships, for instance severe difficulties in sustaining relation-\nships or problems in feeling close to others\" [Stadtmann, Manuel P., et al](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328391636_Mastering_life_together_-_symptom_management_views_and_experiences_of_relatives_of_persons_with_CPTSD_a_grounded_theory_study)\n\n\n_____________\n\n##### **Some sources:**\n\n- [DSM-5 Criteria for PTSD](https://www.brainline.org/article/dsm-5-criteria-ptsd)\n- [Positive affirmation for CPTSD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SAdAGUNBHI)\n- [Frequently Asked Questions About Complex PTSD](http://www.pete-walker.com/fAQsComplexPTSD.html)\n- [A lot of other good articles about CPTSD related topics](http://www.pete-walker.com/)\n- “Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving” by Pete Walker (recommended by many)\n- [Hypervigilance and How to Overcome It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXfY-fTZn1s) there is also very good thought out top comment underneath it.\n- [Minding the Body, Mending the Mind](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/minding-the-body-mending-the-mind-joan-borysenko/1100337810#/) by Joan Borysenko\n- [Waking the Tiger: Healing Trauma](https://www.amazon.com/Waking-Tiger-Healing-Peter-Levine/dp/155643233X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1535757739&sr=8-1&keywords=taming+the+tiger+peter+levine) by Peter A.

      "description":"Strength in struggles means that individuals who have been bullied, have ADHD, BPD, DPD, or have experienced academic failure have the ability to overcome adversity and grow stronger as a result. These individuals demonstrate resilience, perseverance, and determination in the face of challenges. They learn to navigate and manage their emotions, develop coping strategies, and seek support when needed. Through their struggles, they gain valuable life skills, empathy, and a deeper understanding of themselves and others. Their experiences can also serve as a source of inspiration and motivation for others facing similar difficulties. Overall, strength in struggles is a testament to the human spirit and the capacity for personal growth and transformation.\n\n- Positive: Maintaining a positive mindset while studying can greatly improve productivity and motivation.\n- Pain sharing: Sharing the challenges and difficulties faced during the study process can help alleviate stress and provide a sense of support.\n- Vent: Expressing frustrations or concerns about studying can be cathartic and help release tension.\n- Rent: Creating a dedicated study space, whether it's a corner of a room or a separate area, can enhance focus and minimize distractions.\n- Friends: Surrounding oneself with supportive and like-minded friends can provide encouragement and create a conducive study environment.\n- Knowing each other: Building strong relationships with study partners can foster trust and effective collaboration.\n- Sharing each day what I do without shame: Being open and honest about study habits and progress can lead to accountability and self-improvement.\n- Helping others: Offering assistance to fellow students not only reinforces knowledge but also cultivates a sense of community and mutual growth.\n-If you happen to encounter any challenges that you may forget about, there is a convenient solution available. You can easily set up reminders  in the daily section of your  habitica setup on down  then on  device's settings. By overriding the \"do not disturb\" system and enabling notifications of habitica. you can ensure that you receive timely alerts as needed. This feature allows you to stay organized and on top of your tasks with ease.",

      "description":"The Artist's Way is a book and course on fostering creativity written by Julia Cameron (and Mark Bryan).  We are all creative by nature, no matter how it often seems that the opposite is true, and the challenges here would be based on the lessons in the book.  The concepts can be used for your traditional art practice, or applied to the canvas of your life in general.  If you don't have the book, you can still join in; however, you will miss the depth the authors provide.\n\nPlease introduce yourselves in the chat, and tell us a bit about your creative projects, what you're working on, what you're struggling with, etc. Always be respectful. This is a place to encourage each other, give tips, and discuss the exercises in the book.\n\nAs an introduction to the course, I recommend you start the basic activity that will be the foundation of the benefit you get from the course. It's called Morning Pages, and it consists of three pages of brain dump that you do first thing in the morning. It's not a journal at all, and not meant to even be read (but you should keep them anyway). It's a technique for decluttering the mind and letting the creative pathways open up. They don't have to make any sense or serve any other purpose. I admit, I use the computer most of the time. I seem to think better that way, but the authors' recommendation is to write longhand, and NOT to correct or review what is going down onto the page. It is adamantly not \"writing\" in the sense of composing your thoughts or making a point. You're just using a pen and paper to unload your mind of the vast nonsense that plagues us all.",

Feel free to share your experience with various learning material or methods.\n\n&nbsp; \n\nThis includes jdramas, animes, talk shows, interviews, and whatever you use to immerse yourself. Happy learning!\n\n&nbsp;  \n\n# Learning Resources\n\n+ (Dictionary) [Jisho](https://jisho.org) - There are many dictionaries but Jisho is probably the friendliest of all. Use tags to look for specific things such as #kanji or #sentence!\n+ (Essential) [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net) - This is a MUST! You'll have to learn more than two thousands of kanji. It can be used for vocabulary as well but it saves years of studying if you set it up early. (Ask us if you don't know how!)\n\n## Intermediate\n\n+ (Listening) [毎日の聞き取り50日](https://langoal.com/books/everyday-listening50.html) - Short (two-pages long) lessons with only listening tasks. The learning curve is not too steep, it's great for beginners! If you cannot afford it, most libraries have it and there are some versions online for free.\n+ (Kanji) [Basic Kanji Book](https://shop.whiterabbitjapan.com/products/basic-kanji-book-vol-1) - A series followed by Intermediate Kanji Book 1 & 2. It doesn't only teach you the kanji's readings and stroke order but compounds as well based on previously learned kanjis. If you cannot afford it, most libraries have it and there are some versions online for free.\n+ (Kanji) [WaniKani](https://www.wanikani.com) - NOT free! It uses SRS just like Anki and mnemonics to help you remember kanji. I found it helpful but I am not subscribed anymore.\n+ (Reading) [さくら多読ラボ](https://jgrpg-sakura.com/) - Short stories with simple language. It might seem intimidating first but it is a great reading practice. Login is required!\n+ (Reading) [NHK NEWS WEB EASY](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/easy/) - NHK news articles with an easier language and furigana over the kanji. You'll find the latter annoying after a while.\n+ (Reading) [ふしぎねこのきゅーちゃん](http://sai-zen-sen.jp/comics/twi4/fushigineko/0001.html) - Cute 4-panel comics in simple language!\n+ (Grammar) [日本語の森：JLPT N3 文法！](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6bZA2xVBkE) - A video summary of all their (old) N3 grammar lessons. The explanations are in Japanese, they are super simple and yet super effective.\n+ (Grammar + Vocabulary) [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com) - While Duolingo teaches grammar, I only recommend it for picking up some vocabulary as it lacks explanation. It's also great to get you started studying for the day due to the bite-sized lessons but itself alone is far from enough to learn a language.\n+ (Grammar + Vocabulary) [Maggie Sensei](http://maggiesensei.com) - Detailed and down-to-earth explanations of various grammatical structures and some vocabulary.\n+ (Textbook) [Tobira](https://tobiraweb.9640.jp/) - It is said to be a follow-up to Genki. Pretty difficult to study with it alone but it is great in groups. It has a LOT of online resources. If you major in Japanese, you'll probably meet this series. It has a grammar and a kanji book as well.\n\n## Advanced\n\n+ (Dictionary) [Weblio辞書](https://www.weblio.jp) - Jisho's big brother, a more in-depth and less learner-friendly dictionary for when jisho fails you.\n+ (Listening) [NHKラジオニューユ](http://www.nhk.or.jp/radionews/) - News podcast, you can listen to the articles with a normal or a slower speed.\n+ (Grammar & Vocabulary) [日本語敬語トレーニング](https://shop.whiterabbitjapan.com/products/nihongo-keigo-training) - I found this an incredible help with studying 敬語. Great vocabulary  lists, short but useful grammar explanations, and audio for almost everything. The only downside to it is that there aren't too many tasks per lesson.",

If you have strong Latin skills or a strong interest in the language, along with creative solutions to Habitica's pun-tastic ways and attention to or love of Latin's grammar and flexibility, you are more than welcome to join us on this adventure. \n\nThe Guidance for Linguists says that in order to be a translator, one should be fluent in the language. While we will strive for excellence, how many of are fluent in this, our language of choice? (If we have anyone, please step up and endeavor to become a reviewer!) So, that rule is relaxed of necessity, and translators will be expected to know their limits and, hopefully, have a great deal of fun and learn a lot while contributing.\n\n* The Latin produced so far looks to mostly be Classical and takes what it needs from modern Latin solutions to internet and other new realms of vocabulary. _Nota bene_, no one who pronounces their `c` like the `ch` in the English word `chair` will be turned away. Seriously, let's not argue about \"correct\" Latin pronunciation here! \n* The main language in the Guild is anticipated to be English. \n\n### [translate.habitica.com](https://translate.habitica.com/projects/habitica/)\n\n* [Latin home page on Weblate](https://translate.habitica.com/languages/la/habitica/)\n* [Latin Glossary on Weblate](https://translate.habitica.com/dictionaries/habitica/la/)\n\n## Res dignae\n* [Guidance for Linguists](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Guidance_for_Linguists)\n* [Guidance for Linguistic Scribes](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Guidance_for_Linguistic_Scribes)\n* [Aspiring Linguists of Habitica](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/7732f64c-33ee-4cce-873c-fc28f147a6f7)\n* [Translations Trello Card](https://trello.com/c/SvTsLdRF/12-translations)\n\n## Supplementa\n* [Vocabularia Computatralia](http://www.obta.uw.edu.pl/~draco/docs/voccomp.html)\n* [Computatoria (pdf)](https://boreoccidentales.com/latine/circulus-seattlensis/scitu-digna/computer-terms.pdf)\n* [Lexicon Morganianum (pdf, useful!)](http://www.culturaclasica.com/lingualatina/lexicon_latinum_morgan.pdf)\n* [Neo-Latin Lexicon](http://neolatinlexicon.org/)\n* [Vicipædia](https://la.wikipedia.org)\n* [Victionarium](https://la.wiktionary.org)\n* [Perseus' English → Latin search](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/definitionlookup?type=begin&lang=la)",

I have struggled pretty badly with alcohol in the past and i can confidently say that Habitica has been one of the foundation stones of my success in gaining control back over the Demon Drink. Other foundation stones include meditation, reading, learning guitar and a consistent committed approach to diet and exercise. These are all habits that this wonderful app has helped me to identify and track since i signed up 60 days ago. However I am not naive enough to think that i have finally slain the beast that is alcohol - It is clear that a successful life is an edifice that must be rebuilt every day, brick by brick, and i would love like minded people to join this guild and help each other to rebuild a more positive life every day :) ",

      "description":"![COCO](https://i.imgur.com/QsaFzNv.png) \n\n&#160;\n---\nWelcome to the \n# Completion Colosseum\n\n&#160;\n\n*Accept the challenges of Life so that you can Feel the exhilaration of victory*\n\n&#160;\n\n### Description\n\nThe Colosseum is built to both offer a hub for Colosseum challenges and allow other users to develop such challenges. Colosseum challenges are designed to be 1) actual challenges of real life tasks 2) a method for attaining gems 3) a gamified challenge experience 4) a competition. \n\nMany of the official challenges of the Colosseum will be posted publicly, but updates regarding those challenges will be posted here. Additionally, more unofficial challenges following the guidelines of the  above might also be posted here by other players allowing for competition and improvement. \n\n---\n\n### Colosseum Rules\n\n&#160;\n1. GEM CHALLENGES ONLY: If you are posting a challenge then it must have a gem reward of at least 1 and offer some form of competition. It’s also preferred that this follows a gamified theme. As we are inside the colosseum, something considering this might help. \n\n2. SPECTATORS: If you are participating in an official challenge, be sure to review the individual rules. When an official challenge also requires an official “spectators” challenge, you may only receive the rewards from one. \n\n3. SPORTSMANSHIP: Be a good sport. You won’t win everything, especially randomly selected challenges. Support and congratulate winners, come back and try the next challenge.  \n\n4. HAVE FUN! This is intended for entertainment in addition to some improvement as well. Whether you are cheering or participating or creating challenges, have some fun along the way. \n\n&#160;\n\n---\nIn the Game\n\nThe Completion Colosseum was recently added to Habitica City, the co-opted work of [Shadow](https://habitica.com/challenges/8c26aea4-06f3-4c61-afde-218f55005a71) and Solose the Determined. Thanks to their combined ingenuity and their magic, the colosseum is capable of housing several different small competitions at once. The main “Arena Stage” is reserved for Official Challenges, however not all take place here. The Great Habitican Race takes the entire continent of Habitican, but the magic of Shadow and Solose allow for specific snippets of the race to be projected onto the field. \n---\n\n&#160;\n\nA posting on the Colosseum wall next to competition sign-ups states the following *”May the Odds Be Ever in Your Favor.”* \n",

      "description":"# ***With the discontinuation of guilds, we will be gathering on [Discord](https://discord.gg/DacFKtsNUE) so please join us there!!***\n\nHaving trouble with your reading? This guild not only deals with major problems such as time management, long TBR (To-Be-Read) lists, and buying too many books, but it also makes tackling these problems fun!\n\nThis guild attempts to solve your reading problems through quest-like challenges where you can fight monsters such as the vile Bookwyrm, Sqwandyr, and the Reidmorr. You will work together with fellow Habiticans to foster good reading habits and defeat bad habits. Most importantly, you'll have fun!\n\nIf you have any questions about the guild, just ask in the guild chat or check the [wiki page](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/The_Keep:Gamified_Reading).\n\n---\n\n## Challenges\n\nWe have many different monsters you can join in fighting to solve different problems. All challenges are compatible with each other, so feel free to join as many as you want!\n\n### [The Bookwyrm](https://habitica.com/challenges/6f1431bd-8931-436f-831b-955294ca2e74)\n\nThe Bookwyrm was first tested and loved in [The Bookworms](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/381f73d0-087d-4426-86df-f4cfd3d7ab4c) guild.\n\nThe Bookwyrm is a vile monster that attempts to make people read so much that they forget to do other things they should do. When it fails to do this, it tries to make you not read at all.\n\nThe goal of the Bookwyrm challenges is to accomplish your reading goals without the rest of your life getting pushed aside.\n\nFrom the blog of @loverofbooks: [The Bookwyrm Method](https://seewitheyesclosed.com/blog/article/bookwyrm-method)\n\n### [Tedium](https://habitica.com/challenges/3c1d404e-75f1-4a40-9209-86fba8f43a90)\n\nWhat do Les Misérables, Don Quixote, and Lord of the Rings all have in common? They're all so good, and they're all soooo long. If you've felt yourself get bored easily when reading longer texts, join us in our battle against Tedium!\n\n### [The Reidmorr](https://habitica.com/challenges/e08c91be-51de-4f2c-a7c7-12ea280bad83)\n\nThe Reidmorr feeds on long TBR lists. To ensure plenty of food, it shows people tons of books they want to read but never lets them get around to reading them.\n\n### [Tymeles](https://habitica.com/challenges/ca80972a-e1a5-4ea2-aaf9-ea5dc62a3096)\n\nWhile the Bookwyrm tries to get people to read when they should do something else, Tymeles persuades people into doing other things when they should be reading and then tells them that it’s okay because they don’t have enough time to read.\n\n### [2023 Reading Bingo](https://habitica.com/challenges/5e8dce28-224f-42c1-abd2-aea90df3fb67)\n\nThanks to the efforts of @KyraShadow the Reading Bingo challenge is live for 2023!\n\nHave you played Bingo? Probably. But have you played bingo with a whole guild working together? Probably not.\n\nIn this challenge, you'll get to read books in different categories. When 50% read a book from a category, the square gets crossed off.\n\n### [Sqwandyr](https://habitica.com/challenges/4de27001-e795-4e5e-8d3f-3bdd41612845)\n\nSqwandyr tries to get people to buy more books than they need whenever they go shopping for books.\n\n_Have an idea for a new monster or challenge? PM @amacam_\n\n---\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nBy using this guild, you agree to:\n\n- Be respectful of other people\n- Don't get angry at other people's reading preferences\n- Follow the [Community Guidelines](https://habitica.com/static/community-guidelines)\n\nIf you're going to roleplay, keep your virtual hands to yourself and don't interfere with other people's roleplay unless you have their permission.\n\n**Posting Etiquette** You are encouraged to put weekly updates in a single post, and when joining Bingo for the first time, you're encouraged to put all of the bingo prompts completed earlier in the year in a single post. Check-ins throughout the week are welcome, and responses to what other folks are reading make us all feel more engaged! \n\n---\n\n## Officers\n\nIf you have any questions, just ask in the guild chat and one of our officers or another helpful sprite from the guild will assist you. These fantastic beings help us all with the good, the bad, and the confusing in both the guild world and the reading world. We are lucky to have them around.\n\n@Cinnaberries\n\n@wyemu\n\n@KyraShadow\n\nSee the Gamified Reading Wiki's [Guidance for Officers](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/The_Keep:Gamified_Reading/Officers) if you are interested in becoming an officer.\n\n---\n\n## Gem Donation `under construction while @amacam figures things out`\n\n---\n\n## Guild Milestones\n\nOctober 31, 2019: Opening day!

Anderson*\n\n---\n\n**Witchcraft is a collection of practices within a spiritual context to create meaningful change in oneself and one's life, but it is not a religion.** Witchcraft is practiced by atheists, agnostics, and believers of many organized religions, including Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, and Hinduism. To borrow some phrasing from the American Council of Witches, **a witch seeks to understand and control the forces within themselves in order to live life wisely and well, without harm to others, and in harmony with nature.**\n\nThis guild will focus on secular and science-based practices, but all witches are welcome here regardless of their religious beliefs!\n\n---\n\n*\"Thank you for joining with me tonight in ritual.

The new Daily Frogs Challenge is now up and running, and posted below with the other challenges.**\n\n---\n\n\n**Image & Link Sharing Policy**  \nPlease feel free to post links you find useful and links to images of your planners in the chat so we can see your awesome planning. Please acknowledge in your post if your link contains content that violates the [Community Guidelines](https://habitica.com/static/community-guidelines) (such as swearing, election partisanship etc). If a particular layout or link is especially helpful, then let me know and I will put it in the Useful Links section below (if it is a layout or personal link i will ask the poster's permission to do so first).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**How to Post an Image into Guild Chat**\n\n\nTo post an image to the guild, you can upload images to [Imgur](http://imgur.com/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/), [Photobucket](http://photobucket.com/), [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/), or other image hosting site of your choice, and then copy and paste the image's link into the chat box! For example, to upload pictures using Imgur, go to [Imgur](http://imgur.com/), click on `New Post` near the top and `Upload Picture`. Copy and paste the link from there into the chat box and add the appropriate markdown as required (as listed in the formatting help under the chat box) and any content warnings as required by the *Image and Link Sharing Policy* above then post to the guild!\n\n---\n\n**Useful Links**\n\n\n[Using Habitica as a Planner](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Habitica_Planner)\n\n[Official Bullet Journal Site](http://bulletjournal.com/)\n\n [Mini guide to Bullet Journals](http://lifehacker.com/the-bullet-journal-minus-the-hype-is-actually-a-reall-1786382012)\n\n[Using a Bullet Journal for Mental Health guide](https://www.buzzfeed.com/rachelwmiller/mental-health-bullet-journal?utm_term=.sv3Y9QNB3L#.nf0RdQ3A8y)\n\n[Bullet Journal tutorial video for people with ADHD (but also useful for the rest of us too!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkZEEQG6IVE)\n\n[Running tracker / log ideas for Bullet Journals](http://www.runnersworld.com/running-gear/11-impressive-bullet-journal-designs-runners-are-using)\n\n[Bullet Journal Your Way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nasMrmSumBU)\n\n[Printable papers - dot grid, lined etc](https://inspirationhut.net/printable-paper/)\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**PA Glossary**\n\n:notebook: **BuJo -** abbreviation for Bullet Journal \n\n:frog: **Froggodoro(s) -** a Pomodoro or a Pomodoro set that is used to focus on or start working on frog tasks. See *Frog Task* and *Pomodoro* below.\n\n:frog: **Frog task(s) -** That task or those tasks you have been procrastinating on and do not want to do. For frog emoji write : frog : without spaces. Name taken from the Mark Twain quote “Eat a live frog first thing in the morning and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day.”.\n\n:tomato: **Pomodoro(s) -** A period of 25 mins followed by a 5 minute break. After a set of four 'pomodoros', there is a longer break of usually 15-30 minutes. Borrowed from the time management system called the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) developed by Francesco Cirillo\n\n&nbsp;\n___\n\n\n**To Newbies of the Guild:**\n\n Welcome and well met. Just a word to starting your bullet journal. Don't get too involved with making it pretty. Don't feel like everyone has better handwriting than you do...Basically don't compare your current work with others. See something you like, Pinterest it for future inspiration. Maybe do a quick list of things you need to be better organized and start from there. The bujo is meant to be flexible to ***your*** needs. It's organic, it grows from you, you grow from it. It is addictive, if you are the artsy-crafty type you can go back when the pressure is off and decorate all you like.\n\n\n~ As written by the wise @Lady Moondreamer and copied here with permission ~\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n",

It looks something like this:\n`[url=https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48690009541_eb16406701_m.jpg[/img][/url][url=https://flic.kr/p/2hbz2v8]Title[/url] by

Habitica chat, use this format:\n`![name](URL)`\n* The name is irrelevant, so put anything you want, with the Flickr link in the parentheses

Aqui podemos discutir terminologia, pedir opiniões, tirar dúvidas e debater outros assuntos relacionados às traduções.  \n\nUm bom lugar para começar a sua viagem nas turbulentas águas da tradução é a página [Guidance for Linguists](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Guidance_for_Linguists), que explica como funciona a tradução em Habitica e os passos principais a seguir. Na guilda [Commonwealth of i18n (Aspiring Linguists)](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/7732f64c-33ee-4cce-873c-fc28f147a6f7) você encontrará uma comunidade dedicada à tradução e mais links úteis.\n\nSe ainda não conhece muito bem a ferramenta, poderá explorar a [Wiki](https://habitica.fandom.com/pt-br/wiki/P%C3%A1gina_principal) para se familiarizar com o vasto mundo que é Habitica.\n\nPara Português Europeu (PT-PT), recomendamos que visite a Guilda [Tradutores Portugueses](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/b00daeff-c9a5-4459-9466-03d5d83d06ec).\n\nQualquer dúvida sobre tradução (PT-BR) pode ser colocada aqui nesta Guilda. Dúvidas gerais sobre a ferramenta deverão ser perguntadas na [Taverna](https://habitica.com/groups/tavern) ou na Guilda [Habitica Help: Ask a Question](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/5481ccf3-5d2d-48a9-a871-70a7380cee5a).\n\n**Boas traduções!** :smile:\n\n![Links & Tools](https://i.ibb.co/gmf2J4M/logo-Links-NTools.png)\n\n* **Entrou agora?** Um bom ponto de partida é se juntar ao desafio **[:collision: Conquistando meu primeiro Tier :collision:](https://habitica.com/challenges/d3ff9617-4a91-4561-ad71-0c44014f1059)**.

It was long forgotten, but it has now been found once more, and will serve the same purpose...*\n\n`As he stood on the mountain's summit he could see the valley stretched below him. As he thought of what he was going to build here, castles sprung up from the ground in front of him. A palace of white marble built itself around him, assembling itself brick by brick. Forests grew outside, filled with mystical creatures. He closed his eyes to inhale the fresh, clean air, but when his eyes opened once more, it had all gone. It was his imagination. But he was desperate to for other Habiticans to see this picture...`\n\nWelcome to the roleplay!\n\nRules for roleplay:\n\n1. Your character can't be OP (over-powered).\n\n2. No gore. Getting knocked of your feet is fine, but no violent descriptions.\n\n3. No inappropriate descriptions.\n\n4. No taking control of characters you don't own (mind-control etc.)\n\n5. Talk to the group before making big decisions that could change the course of the roleplay.\n\n\nTips:\n\n// = OOC (Out of character)\n\n*Italics* = Thoughts\n\n\"Quotation marks\" = Dialogue\n\n`Backticks` = Actions. A backtick is this: `\n\n\nTips welcome!\n\n\nCurrent Storyline: `A dark force is beginning to take hold of the Valley, and our characters have heard whispered rumours of corruption.`\n\n(Fun fact: Fortellingenes Dal is Norwegian for Valley of Tales!)",

\n2023年8月8日に、Habiticaのギルド機能が廃止されるそうです（[公式のお知らせ](https://habitica.com/static/tavern-and-guilds)）。このギルドもそれ以降は閲覧できなくなるものと思われます。ギルドで開催中のチャレンジも、すでに参加している方以外はアクセスできなくなるようです。\n\nこれまで日本語訳ギルドを閲覧/投稿していただき、ありがとうございました！\n\nDiscord「Habicita日本語ギルド」\nhttps://discord.com/invite/6ANK2UwhgC  \n↑Habiticaの日本語ユーザー向けのディスコードサーバーだそうです。日本語訳についての情報交換もこちらでできるそうです。\n\n---\n\n## 日本語訳ギルドについて\n\nHabiticaの日本語訳についての相談や作業報告など自由に投稿しましょう。自己紹介や質問などもお気軽にどうぞ。\n\n[コミュニティガイドライン](https://habitica.com/static/community-guidelines)を読んでお互いを尊重した投稿を心がけましょう。リンクや改行を入れたいときは[マークダウン便利表](https://habitica.fandom.com/ja/wiki/マークダウン便利表)が参考になります。\n\n---\n\n## 参加条件\n***▼以下にすべて当てはまる方のみご参加くださいませ***  \n・日本語が母国語、または日本語をネイティブに近いレベルで流暢に読み書きできる    \n・英語を読んで日本語に翻訳できる  \n・Habiticaの基本的な使い方を理解している  \n\n---\n\nHabiticaでは毎月のアップデートで新しい文字列が追加されるため、定期的に翻訳する必要があります。1～2週間に1回くらい[Weblate](https://translate.habitica.com/)を覗いてみると、新しくやることが見つかるかもしれません。\n\nまた、英語版の[Habitica Wiki](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Habitica_Wiki)のページを元にして[Habitica Wiki JP](https://habitica.fandom.com/ja/wiki/Habitica_Wiki)に日本語訳したページを作成する作業はまだ多く残っています。翻訳された時期が古くて、更新された原文ページに合わせて翻訳の修正を必要としているページもたくさんあります。\n\n以下の翻訳についての説明やリンクをよく読んで、手順や注意点を理解できたらいつでも翻訳を始めてOKです。ご自身に合ったペースで進めてください。\n\n---\n\n##

Habiticaへの貢献について\nHabiticaはオープンソースのプロジェクトで、翻訳をはじめ様々な分野でユーザーが貢献して成り立っています。\n\n[Habiticaへの貢献](https://habitica.fandom.com/ja/wiki/Habiticaへの貢献)（[Contributing to Habitica](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Contributing_to_Habitica)）\n\n貢献して審査で評価されると、感謝の印として貢献者段位（Contributor Tier）、実績バッジ、ジェム、限定アイテムなどのごほうびをもらえます。\n\n[貢献者へのごほうび](https://habitica.fandom.com/ja/wiki/貢献者へのごほうび)（[Contributor Rewards](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Contributor_Rewards)）\n\n◆審査には日数がかかる場合があります。また、貢献の質や量によっては希望する段位やごほうびをもらえない場合もあります。ごほうびだけを目当てにするより、貢献自体にやりがいを感じて楽しめる人の方が続けやすいかもしれません。\n\n◆もしHabitica自体を始めたばかりの初心者さんなら、[新ユーザーのためのツアー](https://habitica.com/static/overview)・[よくある質問](https://habitica.com/static/faq/)・[Habitica Wiki JP](https://habitica.fandom.com/ja/wiki/Habitica_Wiki)などを見ながら実際にHabiticaの操作を試して、使い方に慣れることから始めてみましょう。Habiticaの仕組みを理解しておくと適切に翻訳しやすいです。\n\n◆翻訳に参加する前に必ずガイダンスを読みましょう。「翻訳者ガイダンス」と「Wiki翻訳者ガイダンス」は翻訳したページで、最新の情報ではない場合があるため、できれば原文にあたる英語版も確認することをおすすめします。\n\n---\n\n# ゲーム（サイト・アプリ）の翻訳\n\n***∇はじめに以下の２つのガイダンスを必ずお読みください***\n\n***[翻訳者ガイダンス](https://habitica.fandom.com/ja/wiki/翻訳者ガイダンス)***（[Guidance for Linguists](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Guidance_for_Linguists)）\n\n***[ゲーム日本語訳ガイダンス](https://habitica.fandom.com/ja/wiki/ゲーム日本語訳ガイダンス)***（日本語特有の補足情報）\n\n◆Habiticaのウェブサイトやアプリは[Weblate（Linguists Commonwealth）](https://translate.habitica.com/)で翻訳できます。\n\n◆[Linguists Commonwealth（Weblate）翻訳入門](https://habitica.com/challenges/080e92f7-f059-4343-a736-aa06baac0015)チャレンジに参加すると、Habiticaを翻訳する際の注意事項などを学べます。\n\n◆世界各国の翻訳者が集まる公式ギルド[Commonwealth of i18n (Aspiring Linguists)](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/7732f64c-33ee-4cce-873c-fc28f147a6f7)にもぜひ参加しましょう。ときどきHabiticaのモデレーターやスタッフから翻訳や段位の授与について重要なお知らせが投稿されることもあります。モデレーターは名前に★マーク、スタッフは王冠マークがついています。\n\n◆もし英語の文字列に誤字脱字などミスを見つけた場合や、Weblateで何らかの問題が発生している場合は、 admin@habitica.com 宛てにメールでご報告ください。Habitica内の ヘルプ＞バグを報告する からもメールを送れます。Habiticaのスタッフの方が対応してくれます。\n\n***【貢献者段位の申請】*** Weblateで文字列を翻訳したら、貢献者段位やごほうびをもらえる可能性があります。\n貢献を審査してほしいときは[Translation Badge Application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScm1oNbIJvFPDK8MG9Ybu3XEES9WiJgdc9WkMuy202e39JAQw/viewform?c=0&w=1)のフォームに必要事項を記入して送信してください。まだ翻訳を始めて１ヶ月以下のときは、最初の項目で「First Badge」を選びましょう。\n\n通常は１～２ヶ月ごとに申請の審査が行われて、貢献が評価されると順次ごほうびが授与されます（ジェムは自動的に付与されますが、2段以上になって限定装備アイテムを授与されたときは、市場の装備の項目でクラスのフィルターを「なし」または「クラスなし」にしてゴールドで購入する必要があります）。１・３・６か月・１年間と継続的にWeblateで翻訳を続けていくと段位も上がります。続けて活動して今の段位より上の段位をとれそうな実績を積んだら、その度に新しく申請してみると改めて評価してもらえます。\n\n---\n\n# Wikiの翻訳\n***∇はじめに以下の２つのガイダンスを必ずお読みください***\n\n***[Wiki翻訳者ガイダンス](https://habitica.fandom.com/ja/wiki/Wiki翻訳者ガイダンス)***（[Guidance for Linguistic

Wiki](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Habitica_Wiki)のページを元にして日本語版の[Habitica Wiki JP](https://habitica.fandom.com/ja/wiki/Habitica_Wiki)に新しいページを作成して翻訳するときは、このギルドチャットにどのページを翻訳する予定/翻訳中かを投稿していただけると幸いです。\n\n◆ 初めてWikiの日本語訳に参加する方のために[Wiki日本語訳入門チャレンジ](https://habitica.com/challenges/26c5295a-c4d4-4a35-8606-c69378e607af)を無期限で開催しています。いつでも参加したりやめたりできます。手順を確認しながら実際にWikiを翻訳するための[Wikiページを日本語訳する手順](https://habitica.com/challenges/e923f71f-e632-44b9-b520-218f720d2355)というチャレンジもあります。\n\n◆ページの削除やナビゲーションメニューの編集など一部の操作には[アドミン（シスオペ）](https://community.fandom.com/ja/wiki/%E3%83%98%E3%83%AB%E3%83%97:%E3%82%A2%E3%83%89%E3%83%9F%E3%83%B3%E5%88%A9%E7%94%A8%E3%82%AC%E3%82%A4%E3%83%89)の権限が必要です。ギルドリーダーの@sora-01はアドミンの権限を持っています。これらの操作を依頼したい場合はこのギルドでご相談ください。\n\n◆Wikiの編集者が集まる公式ギルド[Wizards of the Wiki](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/9a163b28-ebcf-4e52-87de-5c040ed0f8f8)にもぜひ参加しましょう。原文にあたる英語版Wikiの更新作業に関する話が多いですが、Wikiの翻訳についても話すことができます。\n\n***【貢献者段位の申請】*** Wikiの翻訳で貢献者段位やごほうびをもらうには[The Keep:The Knights Chambers](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/The_Keep:The_Knights_Chambers)で申請する必要があります。記述をよく読んでから、下部の入力欄にユーザー名と希望する段位（Tier）の数を入力して申請ページを作成して、形式に沿って必要事項を入力してください。[Wikiポイント数](https://habitica.fandom.com/ja/wiki/%E7%89%B9%E5%88%A5:Leaderboard)は申請する段位のおおまかな指標となります。今の段位よりも上の段位をとれそうな実績を積んだときは、その度に新しく申請してみると改めて評価してもらえます。\n\n---\n\n### ジェムについて\n\nWikiで使う画像を再現する、Habiticaの挙動をテストする、賞品ありのチャレンジを開催するなど、翻訳や貢献に関する事情でジェムが必要な場合はリーダーからジェムを送ることもできます。プライベートメッセージにてご相談ください。（前リーダーが引退するときに、活動に役立つようにとご厚意でたくさんジェムを頂きました。ありがとうございます！）\n\n---\n\n###  チャレンジについて\n\nこちらの日本語訳ギルド内では、翻訳や貢献に関するチャレンジであれば作成しても大丈夫です。ギルドの内容と無関係なチャレンジはご遠慮ください。チャレンジをテストやスクリーンショット撮影のために一時的に作成したい場合は、[The Challenge Sandbox](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/0cb00017-4074-435d-8b6d-717fabd7d492)ギルドで作成することをおすすめします。ちなみにチャレンジは「登録する場所」をギルドやパーティーに設定して賞品を0にすれば、ジェムが無くても作成できます。\n\n---\n\n###  翻訳のミスについて\n\nHabitica内で日本語訳の誤字脱字などミスを見つけたけど直し方が分からないという方は、このギルドに詳細をご報告ください。ギルドに参加しなくてもチャットに投稿できます。気づいたときに修正します。Habiticaに修正が反映されるまで数日～数か月ほどタイムラグがあります。今は少人数で翻訳しているため対応はゆっくりです。\n\n---\n\n### その他\n\n翻訳の提案や賛成/反対の意見を交わし合うことは推奨されています。リーダーも皆さんと同じ一般ユーザーの一人で、時には間違いもあります。問題を見つけたときやより良い案を出せるときは、ぜひ意見を書き込んでください。翻訳は後から修正も可能です。日本語を読むユーザーのために、より良い日本語訳を一緒に考えていきましょう！\n\n---\n\n## 関連ギルド\n[Commonwealth of

We don't discourage debate but it is not the focus of this guild. Right leaning individuals are expected to defend their beliefs or just stay silent virtually everywhere these days, so this guild is intended to be a refuge away from that pressure. We have a slight US focus, but Right leaning individuals of all countries are welcome, and encouraged to share what it's like for conservatism in their country.\n\n---\n\n## ~ :fire: Rules :fire: ~\n\n- ***Keep things civil.*** This means no personal attacks or just being nasty. Disagreements happen but let's all be mature about it when it does.\n- ***What happens in chat, stays in chat.*** This means if someone disengages with you, do not PM them to try and continue the discussion. This *also* means that you may **not** screenshot or in any way take things discussed in this guild (or an offsite guild chat) outside of the guild chat or one of the linked affiliates. Doxxing is a real threat in the modern world and Habitica is not a friendly place for Conservatives, this rule is for the safety of everyone here. Anyone caught doing this will immediately be banned from the guild and blacklisted.\n\n---\n\n## ~⚔️ Discussion Ideas  ⚔️~\n\n+ *Yourself*—We love hearing about where you line up and why.  \n+ *Your Red Pill Story*—What changed your mind on the big issues?  Were you shunned for asking questions about “sacred” issues?  \n+ *First Amendment*—Should “Hate Speech” be illegal?  Or is it already illegal to be illegal?  \n+ *Second Amendment*—What rights are given up with increased gun control?  Does gun control reduce violent crime?  \n+ *Feminism*—How is Third-Wave Feminism harming women?  What is the effect on men?  Should women be encouraged to exceed in male-dominant areas?  What are the effects of discouraging femininity in women and masculinity in men?  Are there differences between men and women?  \n+ *Religion*—How much do your beliefs influence your politics, and what are they?  \n+ *Alternative Right*—What are your thoughts on the Alt-Right?  Is their overall effect harmful or helpful?  Why is this movement becoming popular right now?",

      "description":"# On September 10, 2022, our guild was **promoted** from Bronze (fewer than 100 members) into a **Silver Tier** guild with 101-999 members, which means we're among the **Top 36%** of [all public guilds](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Guilds_Guide)! :tada:\n---\n\n**To Upload Images**\n\nPer request, the way to add images is to follow the instructions in the [Habitica Wiki](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Gamifying_Your_Lists#:~:text=Habitica%20supports%20emoji%20and%20markdown,%2C%20To%20Do%2C%20or%20Reward.&text=Enter%20the%20full%20URL%20of,jpg).). The way I have been adding images is to enter the following into Habitica: \n\n* Type the following into Habitica = exclamation brackets parentheses (take out the *space* below)\n\n`![]()` or !*space*[*description*]*space*(*_PutImageLink.jpg_*) \n\n* Copy and paste the link to the image to place in between the parentheses (take out the *space* below)\n\n`![]()` or !*space*[*description*]*space*(_PutImageLink.jpg_) \n\n* So, for images to show up, you always have an exclamation preceding both brackets. @mirseum reminds us that “The point of [the brackets] is to provide a description of the image for people who are blind or have low vision who use screen readers.” In addition, you need to put in the link to the image in between the parentheses :smile:\n\n**FOR MOBILE USERS to upload images**\n\n1) Select your image, and download it to your phone (ensure that it's a .jpg or .png file)\n\n2) Go to postimages.org, and select **Choose Images**, and choose the one you want to share from Files.\n\n3) After the image gets uploaded, copy the link from the **Direct Link** section.\n\n4) Go to the [Positive Pictures guild](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/7ac1bc52-9ba8-495f-86a6-874c5a814834), and follow the above section's instructions about typing \n\n![description](link copied)\n\n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n# 12/15/22 Challenge **Winners** Announced :tada:\n\nOut of 16 participants, 6 participants posted images, while 7 participants posted comments. At 32 image posts and 44 image comments, I excluded myself **@IAmProductive** from eligibility for winning. Based on guild activity of 20 image posts and 5 image comments, the main winner was **@lord_of_the_books_**! :tada: Additional winners included **@arielle0** with 7 image posts and 3 image comments + **@envandrare** with 5 image posts and 4 image comments. Thank you to the top 4 most active participants that posted images and comments! :tada: \n________________________________________\n\n# 9/30/22 Challenge **Winners** Announced :tada:\n\nOut of 39 participants, 10 participants posted images, while 16 participants posted comments. The names of all ten people that posted images were put into the Random Name Generator based on the number of images posted, which ranged from one, to 31 times (I excluded myself **@IAmProductive** from eligibility for winning). The Random Name Generator picked **@jprockz367** as the main winner! :tada: Additional winners included **@mirseum** + **@Polar_Jake78** + **@LittleMissFreedom**.

Estruture sua build para que você tenha (considerando os pontos aplicados e de equipamento) no máximo 70 pontos em FOR e concentre todo o restante em INT. É inútil ter mais do que isso em FOR, pois a contribuição para o poder das skills não compensa os pontos gastos, por isso é melhor ter mais INT para poder utilizar as habilidades mais vezes;  \n* Não gaste sua Mana nas skills de POSTURA DEFENSIVA e OLHAR INTIMIDANTE. Elas tem como base o atributo de CONSTITUIÇÃO e são muitos fracas. Deixe essa parte defensiva para os Curandeiros do seu Grupo;\n* A skill da PRESENÇA VALOROSA aumenta a FOR de todos do Grupo, porém não espere muito. O aumento em FOR é muito pequeno. Dependendo de como seu Grupo está estruturado, mais vale gastar sua Mana em GOLPE BRUTAL e causar mais dano aos Chefes;  \n* Caso haja mais Guerreiros no seu Grupo, se organizem quando forem lançar GOLPE BRUTAL para evitar o desperdício de Mana atacando um Boss que \"já vai morrer\". Talvez seja interessante os Guerreiros se revezarem aonde uns atacam e outros buffam o Grupo; \n\n* **IMPORTANTE: Se você utiliza a mecânica de \"comprar mana\" através da aba \"recompensas\", praticamente tudo isso que foi dito sobre aplicar pontos em INT -CAI POR TERRA-. Se você utiliza a mecânica e faz parte de um grupo grande com vários ladinos, -APLIQUE TODOS OS SEUS PONTOS EM FOR e compre a mana-.**\n\n`(Esta sessão da descrição está sempre em atualização.

God is calling you to be a hero, and this Guild is a great place to find like-minded people as we run towards heaven together.\n\nIf life is a video game, God is the game designer. The graphics are great, it's fully interactive (and fully PvP if you want, but that's not a good idea), and your story is custom-built just for you, not too easy because a game that's too easy is no fun. It's not a solo adventure, though, it's massively multiplayer and so your Epic Quest for your life includes others around you. After all, what would Frodo be without the Fellowship to help him, or the Avengers without each other?\n\nLeveling up in holiness can take many forms. To help you get started, I've put together a few perpetual challenges that will always be active. Add whichever ones you think will help you the most at this time, and later you can go back and add the others as you see fit. No need burn out by cramming everything in all at once.\n\nAdditionally, I will run challenges specific to the liturgical season, and those challenges will have a gem prize to the winner. I also will run a Virtue of the Month challenge in the Tavern, which you are welcome to join.\n\nIn case you need a private place to discuss any hot button Church teachings, any sensitive topics such as chastity/sexuality, or anything else that might not be appropriate for a public Guild where users as young as 13 years old can join, you can request to join the Catholic Geeks private Guild by posting in the chat or by messaging the Guild leader.\n\nIt's great to have you here. \n\nPS be a hero today",

Are you looking for a place to discuss how best to define your long-term goals and break them down into achievable short-term goals? If so, this is the place to come!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis guild is for setting goals three months or more in the future. If you want help and encouragement with shorter term goals, please see the [Short-Term Goal Accountability Guild](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/59f699a3-9d22-4d6d-b34a-8fcdf2ad1dac).\n****\nThe **My Long-Term Project** challenge is designed to help you plan, monitor and celebrate your long-term goal. Wherever you are on the journey towards your long-term goal, you can join this challenge to help you plan, reflect, adjust targets and share your problems and triumphs with the guild.  \n  \nIf you want to set a formal SMART goal, the [Set a long-term SMART goal](https://habitica.com/challenges/d6382563-649a-423a-8cf4-a3468b01d55b) challenge will help you to do that. If you're planning a new long-term goal, why not join this challenge to add the relevant tasks to your To-Dos.  \n**Please note: This challenge is a never ending one and there will not be a winner.** Please join the challenge to get the tasks and then leave again. Don't forget to opt to keep the tasks when prompted!  \n  \nWhile working on your long-term goal, it's important to monitor your progress. There is another permanent challenge called [Plan your route up Mount Success](https://habitica.com/challenges/43afe4dc-9439-4cac-9959-7f5d3d4978b3) explains how to set milestones, ie dates when you will check to see how far you have progressed towards your goal. \n\nFinally, though January is the traditional time for looking ahead and making plans for the next year, you may prefer to set your long term goals based on the academic year, or you may just want to start **now** (whenever \"now\" is!). The permanent challenge [Year Review: Planning for Success](https://habitica.com/#/options/groups/challenges/dcc59fd4-528f-4de9-bd38-a57dbaae9dff) will help you do just that.",

      "description":"# 𝖂𝖊𝖑𝖈𝖔𝖒𝖊, 𝕲𝖆𝖒𝖊 𝕸𝖆𝖘𝖙𝖊𝖗𝖘!\nDo you run a tabletop RPG, or are you thinking of trying the whole sitting-behind-the-screen thing out? If so, this is exactly the right place for you! Here, you can share the shenanigans that are happening in your game, ask for advice on how to deal with a situation, or share ideas for quests, encounters, magic items, NPCs, story lines, world building, rules... Anything under the sun! Now, take your complimentary game master hat, introduce yourself if you want, and have fun.\n\n> ***Looking for a game to play in, or looking for players?*** This isn't the right place for it. Ask some of your friends, or try out [rpgtablefinder.com](https://www.rpgtablefinder.com/howitworks), [Roll20](https://roll20.net/), or a similar site instead. There may also be social media groups for your area for finding a group, or you could try visiting a local game store.\n---\n\n### 🧾 *Rules*\n+ Make sure to follow the [Community Guidelines](https://habitica.com/static/community-guidelines), and **please take particular care when describing something that happened in a game.** Habitica is all-ages, so graphic descriptions of more mature material (gore, violence, fantasy drugs, etc. ...) does not belong in Habitica's public guilds, regardless of how awesome that dragon slaying was at the table! c:\n+ Table top games can be a very expensive hobby, but please [**do not share pirated material**](https://habitica.com/static/terms) in this guild, as it violates Habitica's ToS. There are plenty of awesome resources out there that do not violate copyright.\n+ **Be respectful of other people's preferences** and keep the discussion friendly - nobody has to run their game in a specific way. We're all here to help each other and give advice, but you can't force someone to go with your suggestion.\n+ Every time the guild rounds a milestone of 100 users, I'll go through the member list and remove users who have not used Habitica for a year or more.\n   + Anyone is welcome to rejoin at any time, of course!\n+ Habitica's chats can only hold 200 messages at a time, so it's courteous to write one long post rather than several short ones in a row.\n\n---\n\n### :confetti_ball: *[Game Master of the Year](https://habitica.com/challenges/b5d9aa9e-2e6a-4e9c-9ece-2aa1ac645daa) Award Winners*\nQuasiMel\n\n> #### [Submit questions for the prompts here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1rtyrvPAC1ADjXC8dN9of1UX3pKNY1LsCCHOoWfzRn88)\n\n---\n\n### :calendar: *Guild History*\n\n**19-12-2022:** Guild leadership transferred from @MaybeSteveRogers to @RebeccaDoll.\n\n**01-06-2021:** Guild renamed to from *DnD - DM/GM Dungeon Masters and Game Masters* to *The Game Masters' Grotto*.\n\n**14-05-2021:** Guild leadership was transferred from @LadyCyanWolf to @MaybeSteveRogers.\n\n---\n\n### :wave: *Similar Guilds*\n+ [The Board Game Guild](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/807560cd-de48-49e2-9b2f-472d1329ea3d)\n+ [D&D](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/ecfe1fa2-7ca4-497b-beaa-ed449264b30b)\n+ [Key and Quill Inn](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/1fdb53e2-83e5-4f3b-b3a2-fa403dff491f)\n+ [Miniature Wargamers](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/8caf1c9d-b941-4418-8c30-efe359ab2d4c)\n+ [Tabletop Gamers](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/a24a3958-2fda-4c55-a9a6-a1e3d3856df2)\n\n---\n\n#### 🧭 *Search Terms*\ntabletop RPG; dungeons and dragons; DnD; D&D; warhammer; cyberpunk; WH40K; pathfinder; PF; call of cthulhu; COC; star wars; SWRPG; world of darkness; WOD; TTRPG; dungeon master; DM; game master; GM; starfinder; shadowrun; city of mist; d20; pen and paper; P&P; homebrew; 7th sea; MotW; FASERIP; GURPS; PbtA; BitD; vampire: the masquerade\n\n#### *Please feel free to suggest search terms!

Looks, district, backstory, anything else important. I'll add it to the description.   \n### RP plan;   \nDuring  Mockingjay rebellion. Each character can do a bit of their lives, and they can run away to find district 13. Everyone meets in the woods and we go from there.\n\n### RP Characters: \n  \n#### Odilia (Odi) Atlantis: @TempestShadow District 4 female. 15 years old. Tangled, dirty blond hair, usually tied up on top of her head. Sea blue eyes and freckles. Slightly rebellious and sarcastic. She hides her deep fears of being left alone, and attempts to hide her anxiety by being overly brave, crossing the line into straight up recklessness. \n  \n#### Andromeda: @ZoZoTheCatGirlDistrict 4 female. She's sassy and always stands up for herself. She wears her brown hair in a braid, and always wears her grandmother's yellow gown. Her older sister was in the Hunger Games when Andromeda was just 6, and sadly lost.  \n  \n  \n#### Harper Maverick; @princesspenn District 4 male with fuffy-blonde hair and brown eyes he is 18 he is good at running. His shirt is white ,he has blue jeans on with a pink jacket around his waist,he has gloves on\n  \n #### Lightning Anderson. @Ruunaser District 5 male with emo bluish-black hair and pale golden brown eyes. He’s good at tinkering and better at running; reflexes are his best trait. He definitely has ADHD, even if the diagnosis doesn’t exist in Panem, and he’s quite a perky chap with a quick tongue both in joy and anger. Unbeknownst to him, Lightning’s parents have been angling to send him off to the games since before he was born, hence the cliché baby name. They figured he’d either bring home renown or be off their hands for good.\n   \n#### Astrid: @artblockisnotathing District 7 female. 13 years old. She is rather mature for her age, and prefers enjoying the natural beauty of things than talking to other people, which may have led to the development of social anxiety. Unsurprisingly, she is good with axes, but has also trained with archery as a hobby. She has brown eyes and hair with a slight orange tinge, and seems to always be wearing a jacket tied around her waist. Jeans and plain shirts are a common outfit for her. Astrid is distant from the people around her, but feels more in touch with the world and herself. \n  \n#### 11: @11gaming District 3 male.  He's really into gaming (probably won't get the chance though) and is skilled using dual Katanas. Wears blue jeans, A creeper shirt, and a Mario cap, but with an 11 instead of M. He has green eyes and lustrious blond hair underneath his cap.  \n  \n#### Drake Sky: @EchoKid District 3 male. He's an artist but his parents are abusive so he often runs away to sing. he has really strong emotions but he never shows them. He's  depressed but he never cries. He's sick of the way things are. He develops video games in secret and wants to one day be a Game Maker\n  \n#### Chive Grawn: @BattleOfTheWarnings District 9 female, age 12. She has dark skin (from a lot of sun), and brown eyes. She can be a bit annoying, is rather stubborn, and has a little sister (Laurel, age 11).\n  \n### List of the districts:  \nDistrict 1: Jewelry. Wealthiest district, trains tributes, known as Careers.  \nDistrict 2: Masonry and weapon manufacturing.  \nDistrict 3: Technology  \nDistrict 4: Fishing. Children learned how to fish at a very young age, and helped with the districts work.  \nDistrict 5: Power and Electricity.  \nDistrict 6: Transportation.  \nDistrict 7: Lumber  \nDistrict 8: Textiles.  \nDistrict 9: Grain.  \nDistrict 10: Livestock.  \nDistrict 11: Agriculture. Largest district, very strict.  \nDistrict 12: Coal. Katniss' District.The poorest, but also one of the least strict.     \n  \n![map of panem](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/fife/AAWUweXJT9mKmLo8Rua7qk8txRfFggSFLZqUfwwFX5xNUXbp4Rb_3aluklQRxUYFnvo165ub_KvOBDX-AwgMjrf40DJAdJ11xYMLWN-EMUCjDen9cJbXCYoWrDbU49hS-g_0nFlsgKRb3T-tbHg-4D4ScCgtPei-tcHQ5QppmDJgJ7nuttJRrW0Duqs6cIMdQkntIcXp0DlIdeIkQXz59n4tBr9TWu2vHyUIq6-JIQctfntjGOa9M-58m_MB8EDzICQYP-0RWr_wJOyfhEy4V-C3EUnSoNGry6NGKPfOTFGhzK9aXL430g3NqJ-CA8agMWVFCrV-uCF2OwWrUi2I-6nAQnqF6Vdq0v4iLnLUc0c3iDyCG1HTKQ3TR24B7O3P3dmu5YUFtVbQzZqPinub6RIemORAR35aHic5fd89LlZrbzU9qBUfAiIf3QtLfbTafekjtDkNqZA-p48zQEE3B8NnpYqD01mBZ9sCU1DU2asy72mbX1LpBsBC6JDt7oh6JQ6Iz8FI5l4o_q21f6wM9-4Tktm1DqrZ8BU2aKGmnXVNfZyg1_SK2_9iH8wK1cUg0rjzwhhERycC6DK8xPhTJcZ342yVgiJ16xLTJLwbxsRLSs6aAMdQjL3EPLMDndOAg7ai2z4aSbsPX6GrlOcIMPoqSXNPdt9TdZA0hvV9tYBkbtiAL9MKgB1v-w39sL9cCTnonmw6BrAxG0gxofXH_dzpOVlqHJ8MXBLY3DcX=w500-h446?authuser=0)",

We want to create a friendly space for everyone to hang out and embrace exchange about everything vegan!\n\n## Information\n\nOn February 6th 2022 [@maxmoon](https://habitica.com/profile/12631f31-5d3f-4796-b315-ad7115749beb) took over the lead of this guild.

      "description":"![Title](https://i.ibb.co/gPqnZLL/Title-001.jpg)\n\n## Greetings!\n\nWelcome to Geeky Pop Culture Challenges! Here you will find challenges designed to help you to be a healthier person in all aspects of your life: physical, mental, social, spiritual and emotional. And, to help motivate you, each challenge will have a theme based on a pop culture franchise.\n\n---\n\n## General Information on  the Challenges\n\nThese challenges are designed to be undertaken whenever it works for your schedule and most of them are designed to be undertaken multiple times. Because of this, they are perpetual challenges with no end date and no winner.\n\nHowever, starting in Feburary of 2023, public versions of some of our Challenges will be run on a regular basis. See \"The Schedule\" below for more details.\n\nTo keep this guild family-friendly and to open up the challenges to as wide an audience as possible, the challenges will be based off of franchises that are PG-13-ish in nature or tamer.\n\n---\n\n## General Information on the Chat\n\nFeel free to discuss whatever geeky pop-culture related topics you'd like in the chat. To encourage you to follow through, many of the challenges require you to post a comment in the chat room that follows a specific format. This is designed to make those posts easier to find and to encourage your fellow Habiticans who are attempting the same challenge.\n\n---\n\n## The Public Challenge Schedule\n\nFor the first year and a half or so, it was my goal to post a new Challenge every other week. These Challenges are perpetual and not public. They are designed to be joined, left and re-joined at one's leisure and they never end. \n\nIn February of 2023, I took a break from making new Challenges like these and began running public versions of some of the Challenges that we already have. \n\nThese public Challenges will be run for a set time with a prize of gems given to one of the participants at the end of its run.\n\n**The current public Challenge is [Back to the Future (Public Challenge)](https://habitica.com/challenges/e36923fb-edbc-41e3-aa3d-b29369425162). It will run from 3/16/23 through 4/19/23. At that time, a winning participant will be chosen to earn the 5 gem prize!**\n\n---\n\n## The Perpetual Challenges!\n\n:rotating_light: **START WITH THIS CHALLENGE!** :rotating_light:\n\n[Veni, vidi, geeky.](https://habitica.com/challenges/b3c1a8ad-0d3d-4541-bbaf-ee50323f98bd)\n\n**BACK TO THE FUTURE CHALLENGES**\n\n[Back to the Future](https://habitica.com/challenges/ea50cb37-2ff7-4a57-927d-fc8fbfbf9bec)\n\n[Back to the Future Part II](https://habitica.com/challenges/abe5840f-574a-412e-aa50-cac3f78f8648)\n\n**DC COMICS CHALLENGES**\n\n[Superman](https://habitica.com/challenges/55eb3380-bf6d-46ee-ab44-5572228f5f6c)\n\n**DUNGEONS & DRAGONS CHALLENGES**\n\n[Dungeons & Dragons: The Bard Class](https://habitica.com/challenges/5b34633a-a3f2-4f86-aaae-31de5ab1d495)\n\n[Dungeons & Dragons: The Cleric Class](https://habitica.com/challenges/714c42f4-3b7c-483c-8547-f86dde7361b7)\n\n[Dungeons & Dragons: The Fighter Class](https://habitica.com/challenges/d943d14a-4361-4e77-9ada-e377c27dd776)\n\n[Dungeons & Dragons: The Rogue Class](https://habitica.com/challenges/78d10158-e9f6-4052-b7e3-a19b3428b6d2)\n\n[Dungeons & Dragons: The Wizard Class](https://habitica.com/challenges/e8e7ab5d-621d-44a1-be22-57fb75807827)\n\n**GRAVITY FALLS CHALLENGES**\n\n[Gravity Falls -

With that they discovered that they can use magical powers to bring out the true potential of the ninja, but at the cost that it tires them out. They also discovered that they can travel to the spirit world where Yo-kai lived. Without a thought, they immigrated to that location and easily gained full control of it. While humans believe we are extinct, they are wrong. \n\nToday, we have problems. A civil war broke out between the West and East regions of the spirit world, arguing what to do with the yo-kai their that causes bad habits. With that note, I am asking you to take a side and help end this war. I am asking you to train up your productivity to gain out the full potential of you, the ninja. Only then peace will return to the spirit world. \n\nThank You.\n\n@8-Bally; the Ninja Dojo's creater.  \n\nDisclaimer: \n\n1. This story and world is a work of fiction used to help motivate Habitica users in a fun way. \n\n2.  I am not the biggest expert on Japan's history and folklore, so I apologize if I got some facts wrong.\n\n3. Only people of the rouge class can join this guild. ***Just Kidding!

To be a mercenary, all you have to do is help.\n\n**About Requests**\n\nThis guild is not for someone to do all your work for you,... well, maybe if it's very easy work. If your request basically amounts to that, mercenaries are welcome and encouraged to ignore it.\n\nRequests should always be doable without meeting, mailing, or being in a specific location. We are all strangers on the internet and pretty much everyone has their own life to live. Don't ask for days' worth of work or to drop everything and dedicate it all to your request. Asking for something that requires a specific skill set is okay, but there is no guarantee that anyone with that skill will be present or willing to volunteer those skills. If the case is too specific or the work too big, you are probably looking to hire a freelance and that is outside of the scope of this guild. (Freelancers are welcome to redirect clients of a request they would do for a pay to their own page, please notify the guild leader if you do)\n\n**How to**\n\nTo transfer gems, donate them to the player who helped you after the help is received. To transfer gold, one player should remove the amount using the FCV function, while the other should add said amount using FCV. If you have a personal 'bank' system in your Habitica, feel free to use that to transfer funds. Clients who don't rewards the mercenaries will be publicly displayed under here.\n\n**A reminder**\n\nRemember to keep everything friendly and feel free to tell us your story and why you need help.\n\nEven if you can't offer much, some are okay with just a story (but don't count on it, money makes the world go round). \n\nThe guild leader's inbox is open if answering isn't fast enough.\n\n[The Overflow](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/674460cb-8232-47ad-926d-2085b3051464) is in place so if your request needs a lot of chatting, you don't flood this guild. You might be directed to go talk there.\n\n[Accountability Buddies!](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/9585fe1b-854b-4495-9cde-f09dbf2f53d1) may be better suited for your needs, if you need somebody to work at the same time as you.\n\n**Request Form :**\n\n[(copy this... or here's a link to it on pastebin)](https://pastebin.com/6PB6WP8M)\n\n`**Who are you ? :**`\n\n`**What is your request ? :**`\n\n`**Offered reward :**`\n\n`**Estimated time to completion :**`\n\n`**Necessary skills :**`\n\n`**Due date/end of relevance :**`\n\n`**Tell us more (optional) :**`",

      "description":"\"Sensory issues\" refers to any problem integrating sensory information, whether being over-sensitive or under-sensitive. It can manifest by itself or be comorbid with many other disorders, including: Anxiety, AD(H)D, Autism, Misophonia, and OCD. (I myself have all of these.)\n\nSensory issues can cause problems with only one sense, or with all senses. Some examples of sensitivities include: clothing that is too tight, too loose, or made out of an irritating material; being touched, varying from strangers to loved ones, as well as from soft touches to firm touches; being crowded; feeling vibrations; and experiencing irritating light, whether too bright, or blinking/flashing, or being in an irritating spectrum; etc.\n\nIt can cause minor irritation to severe. You may not know someone around you has it if their case is mild and/or they are good at covering it up. But if anyone's ever snapped at you for clicking your pen, jiggling your leg, chewing with your mouth open, etc, you've probably met someone with some level of sensory issues. Please note: we do not choose to be \"picky\" or \"control-freaks,\" and we usually feel _extremely_ bad after we lash out at you, so please have patience.\n\nThis guild is for anyone who has sensory issues as well as anyone who supports those with sensory issues, whether it's just one person (friend or family) or many people (like a therapist). Please feel free to share helpful tips, tricks, resources, and encouragement. However, please keep in mind that no one here can diagnose, treat, or cure you--this guild is not made to replace care from a professional, but rather to provide community & acceptance. Thank you!\n\nI will be posting some resources later (as I find them). Feel free to share any you have & I will add them.\n\n[YouTube Vid for adults with Sensory Processing Disorder](https://youtu.be/A2b6TSy4WQY)",

      "description":"## Welcome to Headmate Habiteers! \n\nYou might have heard this line by a famous US poet: \"I contain multitudes.\" For [plurals](https://morethanone.info), this is very literally true! We range from multiple distinct people who are sharing a body, to ever-shifting flocks of selves with no single \"true\" self. The continuum of plural experience is immense and beautiful! \n\nHere in Headmate Habiteers, we celebrate living life as a collective and find ways for headmates (the people, selves, and beings who share a brain together) to use Habitica together! Whether you're still learning to work together or operate like a team of world-class surgeons, whether you have a dissociative disorder or don't fit into clinical boxes at all, we hope you'll find this guild useful!\n\nThis guild serves mostly as a storage space for plurality-related challenges, although we do welcome light discussion about the day-to-days of plural life. \n\n## Guidelines: \n\nWe adopt the practices outlined for the Tavern in the Community Guidelines (please read them if you haven't already!) with a few specific notes: \n\n**Be excellent to each other.** In this space, we welcome *all* plural systems, regardless of origin, diagnosis, or ability level, and we treat *all* headmates with decency and respect. If you're not comfortable with that, you can still use our task templates, but please consider joining a different guild for your discussion needs. \n\n**Keep discussion light and focused on the topic of the guild: using Habitica and achieving goals as a collective.** We ask that heavier topics like venting, trauma, and debates about identities and terms be moved to more suitable discussion avenues, such as PMs or mental health guilds. While we would like to support a broader range of plural topics, we unfortunately do not have the bandwidth to moderate such discussions at this time. You are always welcome to make your own guild, party, or offsite discussion space, though!  \n\n**Remember that not everyone uses the same language or comes from the same communities!** You're welcome to tell people to not use certain terms for you, but if someone uses terms to describe *themselves* that you don't agree with, please focus on what they are trying to say first and what language they use second.\n\n**As per Habitica TOS, you *must* be bodily thirteen years of age or older to use the site, regardless of the internal age of any headmates.** If a younger headmate participates, they should make it clear that their age refers to internal age and not body age. \n\n## About Privacy\n\nKeep in mind that this guild is a semi-public space. Anyone can make an account and join this guild. As a rule of thumb, **if you wouldn't be comfortable with something being seen by *anyone,* don't post it here!** \n\nAlso, anyone can see the memberlist of this guild, along with the participant lists for challenges.

      "description":"This group is to meant to be a safe place for brainstorming about the challenges that come from having part of one's personality still feel little even after one has grown up. This includes both people who have been diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder as well as those who feel like they built and adult over the kid part of themselves rather than growing up (people who have emotionally real innerkids).\nIt's also hopefully a place vent about/think through challenges that come up in the experiment of reparenting or process of learning to be your own adult.\n\nI firmly believe that if you want to be treated like a kid you should be able to find a safe place and people to help with it. It's a lifestyle choice you should be free to make. However, keep in mind, no one can say for sure how trying the reparenting experiment will turn out for you. Each person is different and each alter system is different. Only you/your system can figure out if reparenting would be good for you to try. \n\nLike any experiment, reparenting can be fun and enjoyable but it can also get messy and not turn out well.\nA note about how this group would be rated if it were a movie: it would be PG. So,then why should minors come back when they are older?\nGreat question! See below.\n\nReparenting by definition (just if you break up the word) means parenting again. Hence, the only reason why minors should not be looking for reparenting is that they should have some form of current (first) parents (regular legal ones, step parents, foster parents, etc) who are doing their best in the role of parents (believe me, most of them will take great offense if a mentor tries to take over for them or even if they find out you are looking into it).\n\nSo, since I really really don't want to annoy anyone's first parents, (I would like to avoid starting World War 3 if possible); I have said that this group is for people of age only. If however you can prove with solid evidence that you just fell out of sky and have not had anyone caring for you since...\n\nNote: this decision does not reflect any content that is inappropriate for kids. In fact, people who have child alters have to protect those littles from mature content since it could trigger flashbacks of abuse. In general, people are typically just as protective of child alters as they would be of children, if not more so.",

This Guild is right for you :wink:\n\nThe Guild also hosts the :fire: Phoenix of Fulfillment / :one: :two: week year challenge series which gets renewed every 13 weeks (12 weeks + 1 for planning and reviewing).\n___\n# Rules\nAll members are required to follow [Habitica's Community Guidelines](https://habitica.com/static/community-guidelines), especially the section related to Public Guilds.\n\nMembers are required to take part in the :fire: Phoenix of Fulfillment / :one: :two: week year challenges and stick to the challenge guidelines.\n\nMost importantly, members are required to both **provide and receive support** in the Guild chat and be **active** (i.e. post at least 1 x p/week for their WAMs).\n___\n# New to the Guild?\n\nPlease introduce yourself in the Guild chat. Tell us a bit about yourself (but stick to Habitica's privacy guidelines) and share your goals for the upcoming/current 12-week year! :smiley: \n\nYou can also fill in this **[Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1X9TuB20hvlQ-7b3d-AxZH74iPhruSO1zcvUU9PpSoqs/edit)** which helps us keep track of who's who in the guild! \n\n(Psst...it *does not* collect your email - we value your privacy.)\n\nTo access info about all the other Guild members who have filled out this form and get to know everyone, check out this **[Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F3XzumW5WISHVtxLpNxD7ixU3a20iW-yDvh0W7xKcbo/edit#gid=669126125)**.\n___\n## Weekly Accountability Meeting Agenda:\n**IMPORTANT NOTE: Please limit your WAMs up to 1500 characters for your \"individual report out\" and leave the rest for feedback and encouragement to the other members.** This way, we'll keep our WAMs short and help everyone keep up with how others are improving! :+1:\n\n1. Individual Report Out: Each member states how they are tracking against their goals and how well they\nexecuted. Here are four areas to focus on:\n     - Your **weekly execution score** (in general and ideally also per goal)\n     - Your **results for the 12 Week Year to date**.\n     - What's working for you? Where are you struggling?\n     - **Intentions** (action commitments) for the coming week (mention anything you plan on doing, how you plan to improve, perhaps mention any weekly goals you might have...)\n2. Feedback and suggestions from the group: As a group, discuss what’s been working well and how to incorporate these techniques into one another’s plan.\n3. **Encouragement**.\n___\n# Resources\n- Brian P.

(reading the book is not necessary but highly recommended)\n- [highlights and notes from the book ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HICMgRH8ew-qZWNnZMz4q_GezFkPUpyu/view?usp=sharing)\n- [the free 12 Week Year Getting Started Course](https://12weekyear.com/) (where you can receive instructions in three pdf booklets).\n- the **[Guild Cuckoo room](https://cuckoo.team/12wyguild)** is a great place to join in group [pomodoro sessions](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Pomodoro). The only rule is if you join in and someone is in the middle of a session (the timer is counting down), *do not* interrupt the timer. Either jump in mid-session or when the next session begins. If you restart the timer, it gets restarted for everyone in the Cuckoo room.\n- **[Blank templates for 12-week year planning and reviewing (version 1 by @D-Ora](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gsVULMH7E6Apq7T6dWirn5jH_Ihb8kzAryJHWlmJmSw/edit?usp=sharing)** - `IMPORTANT NOTE:` please do not edit **anything** in this template since it is public. Copy the worksheets to a separate sheet of your own on your own account.\n\n### [**UPDATED 12-week year spreadsheet for personal use**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mA1Hh2bsJWk6G1O0wdlZJxy4yyV1EeD9smljTgGhT4o/edit#gid=696583917)\nThanks to @EliotThe for this! :clap:\nCopy it to your own Drive for your personal use. The most important features include:\n- All tactics can be tracked solely through the \"Habit Tracker\" sheet. \n- All the other sheets (like weekly sheets, the 12 Week Year summary, etc.) will automatically take values from the \"Habit Tracker\" sheet to perform computations of scores. You can override this feature if you want.\n- The sheet will look at your plan for the year and your execution data so far to suggest how many times you should perform each of your tactics in the current week to stay on track. Again, this can be overridden with a target number that you set manually.\n- All weekly sheets are pre-made.\n- There is a field for the start date so that you can easily adapt the template for any 12-week period.\n- Some other tweaks and fixes compared to the initial version of the spreadsheet.",

It's something people can experience whether they have others in their lives or not. We can be in a group of people and still feel lonely and not be able to connect on a deeper level.

Are you a paperwork-phobic? Is your document filing \"system\" chaotic? Tax deadline looming ahead? No idea how to fill out that form? This is the place to talk about it and encourage each other.\n\n***Disclaimer:** We (at least most of us) aren't tax consultants and can't replace them. Any advice here comes without guarantee.*\n\n***Warning:** Please protect your own data. It's probably not wise to share your (or ask for someone else's) tax ID, social security number, bank account data, date of birth, etc., in guild chat. If you see any message containing or asking for such data, please flag it so a moderator can delete it.*\n\n[Search terms](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Guild_Creation_and_Maintenance_Tips#Search_Terms):\n\n###### applications, applying, bureaucracy, bureaucratic, data, declarations, digital clutter, documents, elster, files, filing, filling out forms, finances, financial, insurances, letters, offices, official, paperwork, pensions, ring binders, social security, taxes, wills\n\nIf you would like to see a term added or removed, please say so in guild chat!\n\n**Mara's Tax Tips:**\n\n:fire: **The \"house burned down\" method:** Can't find that document (in time)? Where would you get a replacement if your house had burned down? Request a new copy there.\n\n:snail: **Remember the snails:** If there's a deadline, don't forget the time it takes to a) have new copies of necessary documents sent to you (probably via snail mail), and b) send your own stuff so it reaches the recipient in time.\n\n:phone: **Phones are your friends:** Almost every official institution has some sort of phone service line where you can ask things like \"I don't understand this question in that tax form, can you please help me?\" or \"I can't find that document - can you please tell me how much insurance contribution I paid last year?\" The biggest obstacle is usually that they're sometimes not allowed to tell you some critical data on the phone. (But they can usually send them to you by snail mail.)\n\n[:flags:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koinobori) **What do they need this for?** If there's a cryptic question in a form - what do they want to know this for? Do they even need this information in your case (and how much detail is useful)? Can you leave it blank? *(For example: If you know that your income is so low that you'll have to pay zero income tax even without deducting any expenses, you probably don't need to state those expenses.)*\n\n:scream: **(Don't) Panic!** You're a pirate. :skull::boat: You eat tax declarrrations for breakfast. :fishing_pole_and_fish: Or, if you feel like it, panic - and do your taxes anyway. Call it an adventure afterwards. :dragon:\n\nHope this helps!",

It not only benefits yourself, but other creatures, the animals, and the environment, in a major way every single day without taking away anything from you. It's as simple as choosing not to have animals be killed for your meals and we have that choice three times a day 🌱\n\n",

      "description":"# The  OCC exists to connect creative entrepreneurs in the alternative therapy niche.\n\n## What is Alternative Therapy?\n\nAlternative therapy is a collection of beliefs which when studied and applied to a person's life help ease everyday burdens. It's not typically fully understood by science and therefore isn't a standard therapy method. Rather, they are tools individuals can use with minimal training and expertise (no advanced college education).\n\n## Why is it important?\n\nHaving alternatives to everyday pharmaceutical and psychiatric options is essential for a number of reasons. Namely, many people struggle with stigma and personal convictions (whether they're realistic or not) surrounding mainstream help. Furthermore, everyday methods are often expensive and sometimes have other side effects that create more issues with physical and mental health. Lastly, modern medicine is entirely subject to politics and economics which dramatically limits the control a person can have over their health. Alternative methods, though sometimes eccentric to those unfamiliar, simplify these issues. It's easy to quietly study, work at, and learn a preferred course of alternative therapy without the high cost and conspicuous efforts. Lastly, it's entirely possible to personalize alternative care (in fact, that's part of the core idea) to one's own needs.\n\n## What is OCC (this group)?\n\nOCC exists in this app to test the idea that even creators who are driven by intuition and spirit still need the companionship, help, and expertise of fellow creators. The goal of this group is to identify talented creators and equip them with the tools they need to produce modern quality digital content or to create a digital platform. Even though we're studying ancient and natural techniques, the only way our ideas will reach an audience is by competing virtually.\nThrough talking with fellow creators and entrepreneurs you will gain valuable experience. Our goal is to help you define your therapy techniques better, develop a functioning platform, utilize an existing audience ready to demo ideas and refine your own ideas through the power of collective review.\n\n## Who Can Join?\n\nIf you are interested in free therapy, tarot readings, or are looking for free work, don't join. Also, this is not a space for people looking to build a flock or fan club, nor is it for those casually interested in the occult. Please join one of the many amazing occult groups if you are a student with questions!\n\n# The group is intended for entrepreneurs looking to make changes and improve *now*. \n\nFeel free to join if you are working towards any sort of alternative therapy business. That includes anything along the lines of...\n\n+ Starting a Yoga or meditation studio\n+ Virtual spiritual classes\n+ Teaching witchcraft and occultism\n+ Creating kits, jewelry, and items related to witchcraft and spirituality\n+ Launching a Kickstarter for a spiritual product\n+ Are an entrepreneur in need of a digital platform\n+ Have considered teaching a personal spiritual method\n+ Creating and selling intuitively/inspirationally designed art\n+ Are looking to start or expand their spiritual reading service or business\n+ ...and so on!\n\n## Achtung!\nWe do not condone nor will tolerate shills and shams. This group is for those who have actively experienced and wish to share the power of personal healing through spirituality (holistic health). Do not peddle miracle solutions, magical medicine, or other physics-based claims unless you are and can prove you are a pharmacist and the claims you're making is reasonable. In other words, crafting your own teas or simple powders is acceptable, but only with harmless ingredients (ie, teas, simple diet supplements, basic herbalism, etc.) unless you, again, qualify as a pharmacist. If you're not sure what I'm talking about, please refer to dangerous bunk products sold on TV spots by fake spiritualists seeking to dupe the masses for money. Products such as Quicksilver and other 'miracle cures' with absurd costs and claims are not tolerated as they are abusive and give us all a bad name.",

      "description":"Hello and welcome to Habitica's Parents' Guild\n\nMy name is Ankle. I am a mom to a 2 year  old named \"Anklette\".  I am settling into my new role as a mom and now trying to find a balance between motherhood, working full time, and my sanity. \n\n\n\nThe one BIG rule that we have here is that this should be a judgment-free zone. Please be open-minded to other parenting styles, and reread posts to make sure suggestions are supportive, not critical. We all want what is best for our little ones.  \n\nMy one piece of parenting advice:  Know that you are doing an awesome job under difficult circumstances.  We just need to do the best that we can (and \"best\" ranges from day to day) and try to improve the things that we are weak or uncomfortable with. \n\n\nCurrent Challenges\n\nEncouraging Lifelong Leaders--Where parents/caregivers take the time out of their day to sit and read to their child.  Both caregivers and children benefit from this quality time together. \n\nMonkey See, Monkey do--Where you try to show your child positive examples of good behavior.  ",

      "description":"# Hunters, Finders, Seekers, Solvers: Welcome!\n\nWelcome to a place where you can learn to think out-of-the-box and help others to do the same. Here, you can join challenges, post riddles or trivia, and have fun while reshaping your brain to think creatively.  \n---\n\n## Current Public Challenges\n* \n---\n\n![Treasure Chest](https://i.postimg.cc/QxtCYcys/ezgif-com-gif-maker.jpg) \n\n---\n\n## Guild Purpose\n\n* Post riddles, brainteasers, puzzles, trivia, or scavenger hunts\n* Join or create challenges to grow your brainpower\n*  Share your guesses for riddles or work together to solve difficult puzzles with other people in the Guild. \n*  Share interesting bits of trivia\n* Share your favorite ways to grow your brain through puzzles in the chat. ( Have a suggestion for an app or game that includes puzzles or riddles? We'd love to hear it!). \n\n### Riddles\nIf you’d like to post a riddle, trivia, or something similar in the chat (highly encouraged!) you may want to take a few things into consideration:\n* If it’s a particularly difficult one that you’d like lots of people to get the chance to guess at, you could ask for them to PM you with their guesses instead of putting their answer in the chat for everyone to see\n* If you’re responding to a riddle and you have the same guess as someone else, you may want to like their post instead of creating your own so there isn’t just a long series of posts with the same answer\n* If you're responding to a riddle and it doesn't specifically say to PM the answer, feel free to answer in the chat.\n\n### Creating Challenges. \n\n* Creating a demo in the Challenge Sandbox is no longer required, and the Guild settings have been changed so anyone can make a challenge, any time.  \n* You may PM me if you're unsure that your challenge fits the Guild or if you have any questions, but it is no longer required to PM me before posting your challenge. However, make sure it's relevant or I may ask you to delete it.  \n* If you want to create a public challenge instead of a guild challenge but it relates to scavenger hunts, trivia, or riddles, I can add it under \"Current Public Challenges\" if you'd like.  \n* Let me know if you plan on using gems from the Guild Bank in your challenge. It’s 100% fine if you do, though we might run out at some point! Other options are to use gems from your own pocket or simply post it with no gem reward. \n* Feel free to announce it in the chat when you’ve completed your challenge. \n* Types of challenges that are relevant to the Guild include (but are not limited to) scavenger hunts, trivia questions, riddles or a series of riddles, or dailies or habits relating to apps or games that include puzzles or brain games.  \n\n---\n\n\n## :newspaper: News :newspaper:\n\n* If you’re an aspiring pixel artist, feel free to create some art to display in the sidebar that relates to riddles, scavenger hunts, brainteasers, puzzles, etc.\n* If you have any questions about how the guild works, feel free to PM me at any time and I will try to get back to you quickly.\n* The Challenge settings have been changed! Now anyone is free to create a challenge in the Guild at any time.\n\n---\n\n## Guild Rules\n* Always be kind and follow the [Community Guildlines](https://habitica.com/static/community-guidelines)\n* Due to the nature of mystery, some riddles may have an element of violence, murder, or other possible trigger topics. Try to avoid super graphic riddles, and you may want to consider posting a trigger warning with your riddle if it contains a trigger topic.  \n* If the owner of a challenge or the person who has posted a puzzle asks you to not post your answer in the chat, please don’t. It causes a lot of grief for the riddle-asker to have to scrap the challenge or post and come up with a new one because someone announced an answer where everyone can see it. If you did but you realize it right away, be sure to delete your post quickly.\n* If you have a suggestion, problem, or question, definitely PM me! \n\n",

      "description":"Hi! This guild is for people participating in the Inktober/Witchtober/Drawtober/Darktober/Artober/ANYTOBER Challenge!\n\nInktober is an annual ink art challenge started by [Jake Parker](https://www.mrjakeparker.com/), to spend the month of October practicing Ink art. This guild is to support artists who want to use the month of October to hone their skills, in any medium, within the challenge framework. There is some controversy around both Jake and Inktober, as outlined in various articles and [Brushwarriors](https://brushwarriors.com/inktober-alternatives/) - because of this, the guild is expanding its scope to embrace alternatives to Inktober.\n\nThe October Art Guild is an excuse to practice art in a supportive and challenging group. It's more about the actual DOING than the completion of any particular challenge. Creating good art habits is the ultimate goal!\n\n**RULES:**\n\n* This guild is a judgement-free zone; unless a member asks for critique, please be nice.\n* Take care of yourself. This challenge is not supposed to stress you out or add burdens to your life.\n* Take days off if you have to, and feel free to move different challenges if you find a better fit. \n* **No one member can win multiple challenges.**\n* Participants will not be judged on when they post their drawings, if you can't post every day, don't worry about it :)\n\nThis guild is not endorsed or run by the official Inktober, Witchtober, Drawtober, Artober, Darktober, or any other official challenge.",

Respect those beliefs: everyone here has inevitably put a lot of thought in their choice, and understands how hard it was. This being said, neither homophobia nor transphobia is welcome here. This is a safe space for all Christian LGBTQ+ people. \n\n3. To the non-LGBTQ Christians: I (obviously) can't stop you from entering or commenting, but when you do, please remember that this is a safe space for us. Please refrain from saying things that might hurt members of this group, especially when it comes to God's thoughts on homosexuality and transgender people. The reason I created this guild is because issues specific to LGBTQ Christians can only be understood by other LGBTQ Christians. When non-LGBTQ Christians try to help us, it unfortunately often happens that we end up hurt because they don't understand the issue fully.",

      "description":"# JOURNALING GUILD\n\n## MISSION STATEMENT\n\nThis guild is for sharing open-ended journal entries. Do you log a daily record of your (mis)adventures? Keep a dream diary? Attempt gratitude journaling? Write for a visualization exercise? Record work projects for employee evaluations? Post it!\n\nIt's easier to write for other people than for Future You. Writing with an audience in mind forces you to put more effort, thought and context into your words. Years later, when Future You reads your journal entries, Future You will be happy you wrote them as if for a stranger.  \n\n## Notes on confidentiality, sincerity, and purpose:\n\n* This is a public guild, right? Keep that in mind.\n\n* Feel free to obscure names, locations, and events. Don't bother pointing out fictional details like \"My roommate, let's call him Mike....\" Go ahead and just call him Mike. \n\n* Again! No expectation of journalistic veracity here. Set your journal in a metaphorical post-apocalyptic world to describe your battles and struggles to thrive after a divorce, if that's what floats your boat (on a radioactive lake where zombies can't get you). \n\n* Keep in mind that the ultimate purpose of this guild is to produce autobiographical writing you will then save for yourself for later.\n\n## GUILD CHALLENGES.\n\nI will be running weekly challenges with a variety of prompts. I'll specify victory conditions for each challenge. But generally, I will select the winner based on consistency and how much I like the entries.\n\nYou can incorporate the challenge prompt into whatever style journal you're keeping. (*\"I hunted on the mountain. Far below across the radioactive lake, zombies crept up on my daughter. My ex-father-in-law unexpectedly appeared in his boat and grabbed her. Grandfather and granddaughter rowed away from danger as zombies slobbered and growled on the shore. This man is not always on my team, but today I'm **grateful** to him beyond words. I'm also **grateful** that my daughter is immune to radiation.\"*) \n\n## CURRENT CHALLENGES\n\n* [Kindness journal](https://habitica.com/challenges/7a5cd124-ebdd-4e13-8dfd-a7a379e3a9c7)",

All data gets saved in the app. Which... works as long as you use the same device. If you've got a new mobile phone or your tablet just dies suddenly or you reinstall the app, you'll be starting all over. Meaning: you've got to wait until the weekly updated re-editions reach the chapter you read again (in case of Dragon Ball or One Piece this can take like forever) ;-; No problem for the currently publishing series though :)\n+ [Viz](https://www.viz.com/watch) – Premium Anime Streaming.

And the link of you pic has to end with .jpg or .png or any other image format.\n\nTo get such a link I usually post the drawing on my Reddit profile then open the published picture in a new tab to get the link. You can of course use any other website (see list above for some options).\n\n![example](https://preview.redd.it/thk7b9dnkxc91.png?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=48181439832e67bb2feb6ef791c68c0df4899ec7)",

I, Ren, am the sole and exclusive hall-monitor in this space. ⠀\n⠀\nIf somebody says something you find offensive or hurtful please send @renspiritwork a direct message and tell me where to look.⠀\n⠀\nDo not steal my digital hall-monitor badge and engage with the wrong/bad/rude person yourself. Slaying trolls and bigots brings me joy. Putting out massive comment fires makes me tired.⠀\n⠀\nIf you're twitching to respond, send me your scathing reply. I will take it into account when deciding how to handle the issue. 🗡️⠀\n⠀\nThere's only one of me, so do not expect quick resolution. Sometimes I'm sleeping. I sleep a lot, actually. I'm like a cat.⠀\n⠀\n## SHARING, NOT ALWAYS CARING⠀⠀\n⠀\n+ You may not quote/copy/screencap community discussion.⠀\n⠀\n## MAKING FRIENDS⠀\n⠀\n+ You may send follow requests to folks you interact with here. If you mass follow everyone here without interacting I will remove you AND think poorly of you. ⠀\n⠀\n+ Your first direct message to another user MUST read: “May I direct message you?” If they don’t reply, you are not to send them another word. I am very serious about this one. ⠀\n⠀\n## COMMENT POLICY⠀\n⠀\n+ Trigger warnings are considerate, but not mandatory as long as your comment is on topic.⠀\n⠀\n+ If you don't know someone's pronouns, refer to them by their username.⠀\n⠀\n+ Debate is a fantastic and essential skill for our growth. Also, it's BANNED here. I would love for you to debate these ideas with your debate-loving friends over a cup of tea. But nobody here, just by virtue of commenting, has consented to a debate.⠀\n⠀\n## BABIES⠀\n⠀\n+ This class is not for minors, so be sure not to tell me if you're a baby. 👶",

[citrusella, the serving wench](https://habitica.com/profile/2d6ef231-50b4-4a22-90e7-45eb97147a2c) was for a long time its humble guild leader, working to do her best but not always succeeding, but passed the mantle in May 2023 and wishes luck to a new guild leader. Glad to have you here!\n\n#### The Basics\n\nThe main show is over but the chat doesn't have to be! You can chat about the show, related releases like the books or comics or video games or etc. Some chat at times may be connected to challenges as well (but if a challenge is garnering a lot of responses, don't feel like you *have* to chat on the challenge topic if you don't want to!). Just be respectful, follow the community guidelines and TOS (obviously), and hang out with your fellow Crystal Gems! We're all different but we all probably like *Steven Universe*, right?\n\n**Challenges can be made by anyone in this guild**, and they don't cost gems to put in a guild, so if you have an idea and are willing to take a stab at a challenge, go for it! As long as they're related to *Steven Universe* (either directly about it (i.e. a challenge to do something involving *SU*) or via gamification (i.e. a challenge about something else like self-care or studying or something set in the \"universe\" of *SU*)) they're fair game here!\n\n#### Upcoming and recent *Steven Universe* releases\n\n- Steven and Garnet appear in the collaborative fighting game [Multiversus](https://www.multiversus.com/), currently in development. The crewniverse wasn't really involved, according to Ian Jones-Quartey, and while Estelle still voices Garnet, Zach Callison does *not* voice Steven (he is voiced here by Daniel DiVenere).\n- There is a series of anti-racist PSAs that have been released featuring *Steven Universe* characters and written by Rebecca Sugar and Ian Jones-Quartey alongside some a few doctors. There are four in total: the first one (featuring Garnet) came out late October 2020 The second, featuring Pearl, released in early December 2020. A third, featuring Amethyst, released in February 2021, and a fourth with Greg released in April 2021. You can learn more at https://crystalgemsspeakup.com\n- *Unleash the Light* has released to consoles and Steam! Woohoo!\n- There is a full series box set release that includes all five seasons, the movie, and *Future* plus some special features!\n- The *Steven Universe Future* soundtrack has been released, rounding out and completing months of releases of the original series score!\n\n#### Current orders of business:\n\n- Rewatch challenges are occurring RIGHT NOW! We're nearing the middle of the season, when the structure and pacing will be re-evaluated.\n- Looking into starting \"Little Homeschool\" (topic based) and quest-like (amount of time based) challenges within the guild. Little Homeschool has a \"suggestion box\" planned for topic ideas! A first challenge of How to Decide Stuff for Yourself 101 is currently ongoing but if you have ideas, consider sharing them--if you do it as a participant of the suggestion box challenge then you have a shot at 2 gems and a challenge achievement!\n\n#### Ongoing orders of business:\n\n- This survey on [how to best mark/handle spoilers in the guild](https://forms.gle/1akPb4zicdCLsrb26) is still live and allowing responses, but it stopped being checked regularly around March 2020. All the same: Please complete it if you want your voice heard on this issue! It's not all that relevant now, but it could be in the future!\n- Have something you think could spice up the guild but you're not sure if you can or should do it alone? Feel free to share your own ideas in the chat, or start your own challenges, or other things you can think of!\n\n#### Experience *Steven Universe*\n\n**Music (availability may depend on country, all links here are to official sources)**\n\n- [Steven Universe (artist) on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4rF7c8zpCKzuSXohs2HIpA)\n- [Steven Universe Music Official YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBHWILXpCen_ZVKA7ySuEmA/featured)\n- Steven Universe Vol. 1 album ([Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/5MAx9iJP58ErRpSUdrV1Uk), [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mv1dy1EiMOJoNcpU7ECTUGF0J_8rNdUV8))\n- Steven Universe Vol. 2 album ([Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/0Zgc31V2SbW6NLIpeSI3js), [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mq-bgJfpQGmrjoy_ch90pX2FQ5pMM-qAg))\n- Steven Universe: The Movie album (Deluxe Edition) ([Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/4UvcAGFyfXmydWCFZve1LQ), [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nKpubRZoUrokuRzFkj7Vp3GEdI_0E3jUA), [YouTube full album video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8-Uo7uM87U))\n- Steven Universe: Season 1 (score) ([Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/1EyUuDFGVG0TZpV8PnWtnX), [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kqsH2PBy0y5garyYEbfdvIvsHPiw6BFws), [YouTube full album video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQEsSsqhXeI))\n- Steven Universe: Season 2 (score) ([Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/6QJQ5nhzYXjuz1JDNW7HBP), [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lmD3FV-xqE23hEshdE3Tx84CpTbBLf8Bo), [YouTube full album video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tFEnrFZsv8))\n- Steven Universe: Season 3 (score) ([Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/1zMW2d7MorpK7FVyNyAJ61), [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kBjwiDbMNagiE0zjrpxtKfK7AP-4YoZbk), [YouTube full album video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex-fKnj257I))\n- Steven Universe: Season 4 (score) ([Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/6F0hb7PmDDZHtLyx2KrkQH), [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_l21yS8nleLpk9wxf0AfKpRX5K6amdVu5A))\n- Steven Universe: Season 5 (score) ([Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/3h7OVfvBPMBUJSyomHRFzJ), [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_n2ZFwXLQGCJyi3BT4998J3YvuydQ_y9Zs), [YouTube full album video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgKgVCDh1Ys))\n- [A very long video of the entirety of the season 1-5 score albums, with stitched-together animated art of the album covers, can be found here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jU4p1HQEq4)\n- Steven Universe Future soundtrack ([Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/7lLJrKae8050kQViIviAhn), [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nSzUfHPZ6s3_fWHlKQlxYzBlCADnv0osY), [YouTube full album video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuDo9DVrexw))\n\n**Resources for watching episodes**\n\nNote that this guild can only list or condone legal methods of watching, and it is against [Habitica's TOS](https://habitica.com/static/terms) to discuss or share illegal/pirate sources for the episodes.\n\nGeneral and free:\n\n- Check your local library.

If this is your picture and would like me to take it off, please DM me)*\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAre you interested in or using any of the following?  \nHerbs, Plants, Astrology/Zodiacs, Tarot/Oracle Cards, Crystals, Intuition, Meditation, Chakras, Qi/Chi, ...\n\nThese are just a few things associated with modern day witches. There is more than that to being a witch but at the core witchcraft (and witches) is simply about using the power of the universe and the mind to attract wants and desires. It’s about being in tune with Earth’s natural resources and using them to mystically quench a spiritual thirst.\n\nIf this sounds like you, or you are interested in learning more please come ask questions in the Witches of Habitica guild. This is a place for witches following any path to celebrate daily achievements. This is also a place for people interested in learning more about modern day witches and religions in which magick is commonly used, like Wicca, Neo-Paganism or Discordianism.

Many folks post in the guild to say what times they are waking up and going to bed. Join a monthly sleep challenge if you'd like to track your progress alongside others!\n\nDifferent users have different ways of tracking their progress - most make their own systems and use emoji to keep it fun and colorful. If you are curious about anyone's system, it's probably fine to ask!

There has been a lot of talk about apples in the Tavern chat this year, so I decided that it would be great to have a dedicated guild for discussions about apples and other fruits. Feel free to join us – we are a friendly bunch that follow the Habitica [Community Guidelines](https://habitica.com/static/community-guidelines) to ensure that this chat is a welcoming place for all.\n\nA special thank you to @johnjsal for the inspiration (and help) to make this guild and for donating two of the four start-up gems! Also a special thank you to another Habitica user for donating gems to help make this guild and fund several challenges! I'm glad you are a part of this bunch! \n\nCome visit, introduce yourself (or your avatar), and tell us what your favorite fruit is and why. We look forward to meeting you! :smiley:\n\n___\n\n:star: Current challenge: An open guild challenge for sharing a fruit recipe see the Habitica website view of this challenge or the Markdown link in the guild chat. \n\n___\n\nPossible challenges in the next several months include: :seedling: Fruit Seed Planting!, :question: :green_apple: Find a Fruit Challenge and more... :wink: **Notes** These are in no set order. If users have a theme they wish to do in the next month on this list, feel free to suggest it in the chat and the guild leader will try to make that challenge happen as soon as they can. Also more challenge theme suggestions are always welcome in the chat or by PM. :)\n \nApril 2022, March 2022 and February 2022 Theme: No new challenges as guild leader was busy with life.\n\nJanuary 2022 Theme: :eggplant: Whacky Fruits Challenge! This encouraged users to try new to them fruits and learn and share about them in the guild chat.\n\nDecember 2021 Theme was continued fun with the joke challenge as no new challenge was set up.\n\nNovember 2021 Theme was: :banana: Fruit Related, Knock-Knock and other Jokes! As the name suggests users were asked to share fruit related jokes with the guild.\n\nOctober 2021 Theme:  :pear: Fruit Creatures! Users were encouraged to make animals with fruit. Some made snails or birds.\n\nSeptember 2021 Theme:  :pineapple: Fruit Anagrams/Puzzles!

Users were encouraged to share fruit themed puns in the guild chat and in real life. \n\nJune Theme: :tomato: Eat The Rainbow! was a challenge to encourage users to eat fruits of each of the 6 main rainbow colors and share about it in the guild chat. \n\n May Theme: :watermelon: Fruit Emoji Adventure! - Users ate or learned facts related to each of the Markdown format emojis and shared some with us in the guild chat.\n\nApril Theme: :seedling: What's Growing? - About what fruits are in bloom or harvest in the area where people live.\n\nMarch Theme: Fruit 1-2-3's :tomato: :lemon: :pear: A game to learn about and share fruit facts in number order.

Whoops sorry everyone! Maybe another time.]\n\nSeptember 2020 theme: Two fruits and a lie - share two true facts and one that is not true and users will need to guess to figure out what \"fact\" is in fact false! ;) Thank you to a guild member for the idea for this challenge theme! : give three fun facts about produce and someone has to guess which is the lie.\n\nAugust 2020 was Harvest theme were users were asked to share about harvest of fruit in their area.\n\nBefore August 2020 there were a few challenges to encourage new users to join the guild and share fruit themed facts. \n___\n\nIf you want to share any fruit photos (that are following the Habitica community guidelines) you will want to use Markdown format so that both website users and app users can view the image. To share images in Habitica they must be posted on an image sharing site (many people use Trello or Imgur because they are free). Then write in your post what the link will be of [usually like saying - My picture of a strawberry](then put the URL - web address to the page where you have your photo) using Markdown format for links. Please remember to keep art following the community guidelines and appropriate for all ages. ",

      "description":"# Welcome to Overloaded!  \n\n **Is this guild for you?**   \n\nIf you are constantly trying to learn or try something new, but never really have the time . Life is short and there is so much out there in the world, so why can’t we do it all? The short answer – time. We don’t have enough time to learn 100 languages, or to read every book ever written. Maybe you want to master four different instruments but find it hard to even dedicate 15 minutes to one instrument a day. Sometimes we put so much on our to-do lists that none of it actually gets done. \n\nIf any of this sounds like you, looks like this guild is for you!\n\n___\n\n\n\n## *\"You don't have have 'too many interests.' You're an extra interesting person!\"*  \n## *-Mariana Abeid-McDougall*   \nFind more information for multi-talented writers at [@marianamcdougall](https://habitica.com/profile/924376bc-1045-447b-9c3f-4450516fd6c7)'s website [www.multitalentedwriters.com/](https://www.multitalentedwriters.com/)\n\n___\n\n\n\n**How can we help?**   \n\nThat's really the point of a community isn't it? Let's share tips, suggestions, stories - anything that has helped you prioritize the long list of to-dos and dreams into actionable items.\n\nWhile we're the last people who need to add more challenges to our lives, the ones in this guild are meant to help us slow down and figure it out.  Also, all challenges will have gem prizes as an extra incentive!\n\n## Where to start\n# There are no current challenges. Challenges will be added soon. Below are some common challenges that can typically be found here.\n\nI suggest starting with either the \"Clean up your Habitica\" challenge or the \"Passion Roadmap\" challenge. \n* [Clean up your Habitica](https://habitica.com/challenges/91368473-c980-4517-b0a8-812f200630cc) challenges you to go through your guilds, challenges, habits, dailies, to-dos and get rid of anything that is cluttering up your space! This should be a place to organize our thoughts, but I've found myself joining fifteen guilds in a day because they sounded cool only to be hounded with notifications or the guilt that I never actually visit them. Or maybe you have habits that you no longer monitor but they sit there taking up space, or a daily that never gets done because you don't care enough about it anymore. *This is a monthly challenge*\n* [Passion Roadmap](https://habitica.com/challenges/1e0e5ec9-3dec-47ed-9068-8645974266fe) asks you to spend under 30 minutes to write down what you think is important in your life right now, and what dreams you have for the near and far future! By the end of the time you'll have picked on goal to focus on with details to get you started. This is not about ignoring everything else, but mindfully acknowledging what you want and how to seriously work towards something that is going to affect your life positively. \n\n\n**Other current challenges**  \n* N/A  \n\n**Challenges in the works (coming soon)**  \n*  \"Unstuck\" - Note the times where you're feeling \"stuck\" (unable to make progress on anything, unable to actually do anything) and take stock of how you're feeling and maybe what is making you feel \"stuck\" - is it a too long todo list? are you burnt out? maybe you don't know why, and that's making it more difficult to get \"unstuck\". This challenge is all about recognizing those times, with small suggestions on how to get unstuck and encourage you to find ways to beat the monster keeping you from doing the things you want (or need) to do!  \n*  \"Plan it!\" - Is there something you've been dreaming of doing, but are a little overwhelmed on where to start? This challenge will help you plan out your goal bit by bit, including setting aside time to do research, ask this guild for any advice (either on how to make progress on your goal or resources), making a list of resources, determine \"bit picture\" goals and checkpoints. The main point to this challenge to to let you spend the time to plan!  \n*  \"Time Audit\" - sometimes we feel like we either don't have enough time to do something, or that we have a lot of time to add more things. A simple Time Audit asks you to write down how you think you spend your time during a week, how you would like to spend your time during a typical week, and then to actually record your time for a week! The challenge reminds you to allow time for sleeping, spending time with friends/family, doing things that \"recharge\" you (could be watching a movie, talking to a friend, or learning a language), and to try to find a balance that allows you to plan your time effectively but that also doesn't punish you for spontaneity!\n\n\n## Challenges from other guilds\n*Tag nessimug in the chat if you want to add any helpful challenges here from other guilds!*\n\n* [The Reidmorr](https://habitica.com/challenges/a491d7ec-9f0e-4da3-a2ba-4c84fef68b8d): The Reidmorr feeds on long TBR (To-Be-Read) lists. To ensure plenty of food, it shows people tons of books they want to read but never lets them get around to reading them. This monster has invaded Habitica and is wreaking havoc!\n\n\n\n## Message from the guild owner\n\nHi everyone! I'm Nessi [she/her/hers] aka nessimug, and I'm really good at trying to do too much in my life! I just graduated with my third bachelor's degree and started a whole new career, but am already thinking of when I should do my master's degree. I'm also studying Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish. I love to read and wish I had more time to write, though since I'm finally done with school and only have a full time job to worry about I think I might finally have time to start writing again! I've started taking ballet classes again. I started ballet in high school and absolutely loved it so I was very excited to find an online ballet studio so I can someday get to pointe! Other things I'm trying to make time for: learning tarot, knitting, making an app, seeing friends, cooking, rock climbing, and playing video games.\n\nI like having a lot going on so I feel like I always have something to do, but most times I have too many things I want to do and sometimes just end up watching Netflix all day...\n",

Join us, and start sharing your pixels!\n\n\nWant to help make art for Habitica? Start by heading over to  the [Habitica Pixel Art Trello](https://trello.com/b/vwuE9fbO/habitrpg-pixel-art) and reading all the cards in the \"Read First\" column, then come back here when you've been assigned a claim by the staff and you're ready to post your rough drafts!\n\nBeffymaroo visits this guild occasionally, but if you need to contact her please do so on the Trello.\n\n---\n\n**PIP Guild Etiquette**\n\n\n\n**1) Be kind and constructive.** Critique the art, not the artist.\n\n**2) Take feedback graciously.** It's perfectly fine to choose not to incorporate a recommendation, but try not to take it personally or become argumentative.\n\n**3) Respond to feedback.** When you repost a piece, be sure you have incorporated or at least *acknowledged* all of the feedback you have received. Even if you do not agree with all of it, it was still generous of your fellow artists to take the time to review your work.\n\n**4) Try to give more help than you ask for.** Thoughtful critique requires time and energy. Be respectful of your fellow artists by *providing* feedback as well as asking for it.\n\n---\n\n**Helpful Resources:**\n\n[Basic Tips for Habitica Pixel Art in Different Programs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wNxFUjPEEOq5qu4m7-GLowAz9QzGTBh7ezZnfaoHBgA/edit)\n\n[General Pixel Art Tutorial](http://www.pixeljoint.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=11299)\n\n\n[Another Pixel Art Tutorial](http://gasara.deviantart.com/art/Pixel-Art-Tutorial-Basics-for-Beginners-356743783)\n\n\n[Tips for Cleaning Up Pixel Lineart](http://griffsnuff.deviantart.com/art/Pixel-art-Lines-418631432)\n\n---\n\nTip! You can post clickable links by typing **\\[link text\\](url)**.\n\n---\n\n:purple_heart: **Submission Guidelines for Final Drafts on Trello**\n\n**Please keep in mind that drafts posted to Trello should be run through a thorough round of critique. Wait for several people to tell you a piece \"looks done\" or is \"ready for Trello\" before posting**. If you feel you are done and guild members disagree, consider their feedback carefully, acknowledge it, and then you may post to Trello after waiting at least three days for any feedback to trickle in.\n\n**Remember contributors are volunteers, so please be patient and keep in mind that feedback may take longer than you're used to in other forums.**",

(Sadly there won't be all recipes in it which were stated here, I always try to catch em but sometimes I just miss em.

Una vez formado el pequeño hábito, podemos dar el siguiente paso hacia nuestro objetivo aumentando en un nivel la dificultad del desafío.\n\n## Desafíos del gremio\n\n### Niveles de los desafíos\nLos desafíos están organizados y estandarizados en niveles consecutivos. Se recomienda comenzar con los desafíos semanales de Nivel 0, para probar el horario y lugar donde realizar el desafío, el tipo de meditación/ejercicio/estiramientos, su motivación, niveles de energía y compatibilidad con sus rutinas. Cuando consideren que es el momento, pueden unirse a los desafíos de Nivel 1 para iniciar el proceso del desarrollo del pequeño hábito durante 21 días. Una vez alcanzada la racha de **21 días**, habrán completado el desafío y deberán evaluar si sienten que el pequeño hábito ya se encuentra incorporado. Si consideran que aún necesitan más tiempo para establecer el hábito se les recomienda permanecer en este nivel por otro periodo de **21 días**, y volver a evaluar. Por el contrario, si sienten que este desafío ya se ha convertido en algo sencillo y los empieza a aburrir, pueden tomar el desafío del siguiente nivel que los retará a aumentar la duración en 5 minutos más.\n\nNivel 0 - 1 minuto diario  \nNivel 1 - 5 minutos diarios  \nNivel 2 - 10 minutos diarios  \nNivel 3 - 15 minutos diarios  \nNivel 4 - 20 minutos diarios  \nNivel 5 - 25 minutos diarios\n\nEl aumento del nivel de dificultad depende de cada persona, de sus objetivos de desarrollo personal, del nivel de esfuerzo que significa para cada uno, de sus circunstancias externas, etc\n### Premios de los desafíos\nSe entregarán los siguientes premios a cada persona que alcance las siguientes rachas:  \n21 días - 1 gemas  \n42 días - 1 gema  \n63 días - 1 gema  \n84 días - 1 gema  \n\n### Desafíos de duración limitada Nivel 0\n[Actividad Física Nivel 0](https://habitica.com/challenges/2091a7f3-d905-48a3-bb18-b7fac365e9cc)  \n[Estiramiento Nivel 0](https://habitica.com/challenges/cb8fbdfe-6c0d-4a50-a8e3-2fdf671c3569)  \n[Meditación Nivel 0](https://habitica.com/challenges/7feb6916-0c0b-47c7-b40b-9b21fb5885ef)  \n\n### Desafíos indefinidos de 21 días \n[Actividad Física Nivel 1](https://habitica.com/challenges/415829c4-edcc-4b69-bafd-edbd7006f547)  \n[Actividad Física Nivel 2](https://habitica.com/challenges/8ae4d023-047d-41fa-a626-b844c48fd384)  \n[Actividad Física Nivel 3](https://habitica.com/challenges/ed8f6ccc-9f2c-4a89-8c3a-c901b487d9eb)  \n[Actividad Física Nivel 4](https://habitica.com/challenges/85d83925-c3d5-475d-87b8-83cd99e18761)  \n[Actividad Física Nivel 5](https://habitica.com/challenges/dc0b3e0d-e652-4a99-a85c-d80791ffc520)  \n\n[Estiramiento Nivel 1](https://habitica.com/challenges/200d3275-c070-46f8-b7a9-1480105e585c)  \n[Estiramiento Nivel 2](https://habitica.com/challenges/5c21e93b-e43f-4cd7-b1fb-bdd46e6283fc)  \n[Estiramiento Nivel 3](https://habitica.com/challenges/7cc45014-651d-4791-8da4-f8b817e1ab63)  \n[Estiramiento Nivel 4](https://habitica.com/challenges/6fb0f959-882a-4651-a379-2e8b3ca91f16)  \n[Estiramiento Nivel 5](https://habitica.com/challenges/2d12ee1c-bd9c-4850-9658-af16bace0b22)  \n\n[Meditación Nivel 1](https://habitica.com/challenges/c4a54f47-f7ad-41b5-8ddd-f296fbb82040)  \n[Meditación Nivel 2](https://habitica.com/challenges/8fbb727c-7491-417b-b6bf-6c61dcb8f6e9)  \n[Meditación Nivel 3](https://habitica.com/challenges/49e15845-296f-481d-a60a-538e48c5cbf5)  \n[Meditación Nivel 4](https://habitica.com/challenges/faae6e38-1fa1-43d1-ac00-1f6560fbe68f)  \n[Meditación Nivel 5](https://habitica.com/challenges/a6a81e0a-f51a-4dd5-aec6-d232eed9c205)\n\n### Desafío de motivación y regocijo\n[Desafío de motivación y regocijo](https://habitica.com/challenges/6f1ae40b-f300-4ce7-b31e-348fe925ca26)\n\n## Contribuciones al gremio\nSi alguien le gustaría contribuir con el gremio, ya sea con donaciones de gema para financiar los desafíos o con su tiempo como parte de la administración del gremio, le pueden escribir un mensaje a [Lord Fabo](https://habitica.com/private-messages?uuid=275c8b72-bd9a-4eae-981c-a8e2dee24d3).

      "description":"Through taking pictures, we are telling a story of that instance of time, in one visual document.  Often though we don't take time to just take pictures of the mundane (and see the beauty in the simplistic).  This guild is the starting point of a journey to help you develop to be a better photographer.  Start slowly with just taking pictures.  Over time though, work on your craft.  Try a new lens.  Use that unique angle.  Explore lighting.  Do a time exposure.  Play a bit with editing.  Get out of your comfort zone!\n\n*Please upload your pictures daily (if you like), that is the purpose of this guild.* \n\n**How to Embed a Photo Link on Habitica using Flickr**\n\n+ Post the photo on Flickr.\n+ Go to the Share option and change it to BBCode.\n+ Select a suitable resolution (really this is up to you, choose whatever makes you happy).\n+ Copy the string they give you. It looks something like this: ```[url=https://flic.kr/p/2mQMVBn][img]https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51747980095_320fa1f471_k.jpg[/img][/url][url=https://flic.kr/p/2mQMVBn]Jackson Lake - Tetons[/url] by [url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/190639457@N05/]Your Name[/url], on Flickr```\n+ But all you need is this part of it: ```https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51747980095_320fa1f471_k.jpg```\n+ On the Habitica chat, use this format: ```![name](URL)```\n+ The name is irrelevant, so put anything you want, with the Flickr link in the parentheses ```(). ![lake](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51747980095_320fa1f471_k.jpg)```\n+ And this is the result (note: this is a small resolution version for the example):  ![name](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51747980095_f5b7beff1a_m.jpg)\n\nThis guild is here to enlighten and uplift.

      "description":"For those who want to bring more meaning to their lives in Habitica by role playing their daily life progress through the Habitican lens! \n\nAs guilds are closing, we will be moving to Discord. This is, obviously, not moderated by Habitica and has different terms\\rules. https://discord.gg/SeNGwPry\n\nReminder: even when we are role-playing, we are a **public** guild, and therefore subject to the [Habitica Community Guidelines](https://habitica.com/static/community-guidelines) for public areas. Some rules that are easiest to forget while RPing:\n\n- No violence in posts (fighting should be heavily abstracted as in the rest of Habitica. E.g. no blood or gore, you deal/take \"damage\")\n- No profanity\n- Messages must be appropriate for all ages\n\n**Example goal & [keyword substitutions](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Gamifying_Your_Lists):** \n- Exercise = training\n- Boss (work) = master/overlord\n- Homework = study/apprenticeship practice\n- Audition = test/trial before council/gods\n- Video Games (for well-earned fun, not procrastination) = dream realm\n- Computer = portal, magical conduit, etc.\n- Whatever else you can come up with! (we'll put it here)\n\n**[Formatting](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Markdown_Cheat_Sheet) rules:** \n- italics for simple third person actions: *Throws sword to (person).*\n- a dash for 3rd person storytelling: •  And then she knew, the odds were stacked against her. She was not going to complete her quest in time.\n- double slashes before message when Out Of Character: //How do I ____? \n    * Optionally, you can use this to add context to your roleplay: e.g. //The suddenly appearing waterfall was actually a roof leak\n- start with a bold context marker to clarify which story your post belongs to (in progress, suggestions welcome!): \n    * **Fireplace Chat** or **Guild Hall Meeting** or similar - casual conversation with guild members\n    * **Personal Quest** or similar - individual role-play of your day\n    * **Tavern Birds** or other specific group quest name - continuing the named group story-line\n\nFor ease of enjoyment for all, put a character bio on your blurb (through desktop site) that we can reference! \n\nMay your journey be prosperous and fulfilling!\n\n---\n\n**Other Role Play Guilds:**\n\n- [Roleplay Pavillion](https://habitica.com/#/options/groups/guilds/f8111a6f-2e2c-4227-abbb-40b9dc94e2d5)\n- [Mystery Train](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/47fc51a5-0f84-4805-9f2f-e398d628f78e)\n\n---\n\nIf you want to share that you leveled up, you can use normal action format to say something along the lines of: *(your name) suddenly feels ____. They are now level x!* \n\nIn the blank would be your class-specific adjective: \n\n- Warrior = stronger\n- Mage = more powerful\n- Rogue = more cunning\n- Healer = more enlightened\n\nAnnouncements\n---\n---\n\n### Welcome New Members! ###\n\nNo roleplay experience needed, all are welcome to share their tails of triumph, trouble, and self-improvement in Habitica! Check out our [Tour of the Grounds Challenge](https://habitica.com/#/options/groups/challenges/e453d0cb-7e55-4de8-9fee-3be1a5e56019) for help getting settled in. Please stop by the main hall and introduce yourself or let us know how your quests have progressed since we last saw you.\n\n---\n\n\n### Master Storyteller Competition ###\n\nCome join the monthly storytelling competition! Each week, post at least one new tale of triumph, hardship, improvement, or even just regale us with a funny story.  The winner will be chosen randomly from all those who complete all the weeks (or, from those who completed the most of the weeks). The [June Storytelling Competition](https://habitica.com/challenges/0507f06c-de50-48b4-bf08-35f2a13bb1b8) is open.\n\n---\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** *This guild is not an official creation of Habitica or staff. The guild name resemblance to Habitica's tag line is coincidental, but groovy cakes.*",

This Guild is a walkthrough for the game we call Chronic Illness Life.\n\nIf you're brand-new on this chronic illness journey, know that you're not alone. Even if we don't have the same diagnosis, we probably have a lot in common.\n\n## Things you can do in this Guild:\n\n+ Trade tips on how you use Habitica to manage or cope with your illness, stick with routines or make more positive choices\n+ Vent about symptoms, feeling misunderstood by friends/family/doctors, or anything else that's on your mind\n+ Learn about other people's experiences\n+ Encourage and support one another\n+ Join a Challenge geared specifically at those with chronic illnesses. You can find the Guild's challenges in the right sidebar on the web version of Habitica.\n\nAnd much much more! Join us in the Guild chat– we're happy you're here.\n\n\n## Important things to know:\n\n+ Chronic illnesses are complex and might show up differently for someone else – even if they have the same diagnosis as you. For that reason, we try to share our experiences and what's worked for us rather than \"you must do medical things the same way I did\".\n+ Sometimes, people just want to be heard and listened to, not necessarily to get advice. If you want advice, feel free to ask for it. Otherwise, we will generally assume you don't, and will just provide a listening ear.\n+ We aren't medical professionals. We are patients sharing our experiences. You might find some ideas you like here or treatments you want to try, and that's perfectly okay! Please talk to your doctor before making changes to your treatments, especially since chronic illnesses can be complex and affect many body systems.\n+ Please be respectful of others, including those who aren't here in this guild, or those you feel wronged by. It is fine to vent and share your feelings/experiences, however put downs, name calling, hate speech, etc. are not welcome here.\n\n## Resources:\n* [stuffthatworks.health](https://www.stuffthatworks.health/): We're building the biggest patient reported knowledge base for every chronic condition. Together. Help out by sharing your experience!\n* [Bad Day Mode](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Bad_Day_Mode): A custom button that fully heals you, buffs your CON to 9999 so you don't take much damage from negative Habits, and it Stealths all your Dailies so you don't take any damage if you don't complete them.\n\nGuild Co-Leaders: [Foxie](https://habitica.com/profile/4ba28e77-0eb3-41ac-92ee-a1bad0834d8f), [Mike the Monk](https://habitica.com/profile/0034eb14-b4d8-494e-8386-d3f33cff7922), [Bumbleshoot](https://habitica.com/profile/35c3fb6f-fb98-4bc3-b57a-ac01137d0847)\n",

Day](https://habitica.com/challenges/68245ccf-d77a-4910-9037-8a7c0d9d7b36)\n\n🌱 As a personal note, I consider the most important challenge I host to be the vegan one. It not only benefits yourself, but other creatures, the animals, and the environment, in a major way every single day without taking away anything from you. It's as simple as choosing not to have animals be killed for your meals and we have that choice three times a day 🌱\n\n",

Thank you for your help :)\n\n---\n\n## Rules/Guidelines/FAQ\n\nThe points below are guidelines and moderators may make exceptions in certain cases. All challenges mentioned in this guild are assessed on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThis is where you can post about Challenges that should have ended ages ago, are in the wrong place (like a healthy eating Challenge in a Pokemon guild), or for some reason shouldn't exist (whether that's because they have no tasks or because they're naughty or whatever).  \nWe delete posts that we're finished with, so if the guild looks empty, it's because we're being extraordinarily productive, not because no-one posts here. :)\n\n**When posting to propose closures, please provide:** \n- A link to the Challenge\n- The Challenge's name\n- Whether it has participants\n- Whether it has a gem prize\n- Whether the creator is inactive (and if/when you've messaged them yourself about it)\n- Any other useful information we should know!  \nEXAMPLE: _\"Go Eat Good Stuff May 2018  (link) is more than a year overdue. There are a bunch of participants and a 3-gem prize. The creator was active 2 months ago and I messaged them about it then, but I don't think they've signed on since.\"_\n  \nYou can include more than one challenge in a post, but please limit the list to a maximum of 5 per post so as not to overwhelm the mods.  \n  \n**If there is a Challenge that you want to adopt** -- because it's abandoned but you think it's cool, or it's not abandoned but the creator wants you to handle it:\n- Provide the link\n- Tell us if it's abandoned or if the owner is giving it to you (they will need to post here too!)\n- If it needs to move, tell us where it needs to go \n- @-tag Alys, because she's the only one who can do this.  \nEXAMPLE: _\"I want to adopt this abandoned healthy eating Challenge (link) that someone put in the pokemon guild, please move it to this healthy guild (link).\"_ \n\nAs a very loose rule of thumb, we generally don't move on no-end-date-specified Challenges until the creator has been missing 6+ months. (We may move earlier for simple Challenges or those made by a creator who only briefly used Habitica, for example.) If an end date is specified, about 2 months past that.\n\n**I found a Challenge that doesn't need to be removed, but it has profanity!** Yeah, you can post that here and we can fix it ~~, or you can use the mod contact form from the website~~ (mod contact form is currently broken).\n\n**I found a Challenge that has referral links in it!** If it has a referral link, the creator needs to disclose that/the benefits. They also can't lie about the service -- making it sound like it gives you free stuff for nothing, for example. If the creator has not followed these guidelines, you can report the Challenge here ~~, or with the mod contact form~~ (mod contact form is currently broken).\n\n**I found a Challenge that just tells me to join a guild, what's up with that?** In general, Challenges that direct you to join a guild should have other tasks: e.g. \"read this book, and come join our discussion guild\", \"Join our exercise guild, and tell us what your workout routine is\". Challenges that contain only a task to join a guild will probably be deleted by moderators, so please post about them here. There are exceptions to this guideline! For example, a Challenge with just one \"join a Guild\" task that is awarded and recreated frequently is fine.\n\n**I found a Challenge that says it's never ending, but...**  \"Never-ending\" Challenges in the Tavern should still have active owners, so if it's abandoned, post about it here. Never ending Challenges in guilds should have active owners and no gem prize, so if it's abandoned or promises a prize, post about it here.\n",

You have made the darkness a truly lovely place.\n\nPlease, check out our Discord: https://discord.gg/mqP7bbqv\n\nNow, down to business. As we prepare for our inevitable descent into the void, I have some challenge-based announcements. You can find the August links below, but this will be the last month for these challenges. \n\nSince there is no guild to checkin, all check-in tasks have been deleted for now. However, you are welcome to message me (Kelafish) any time regarding the challenges, even if you just want to update me about your progress. I would be happy to hear from you! You can find the link to me as the creator in each challenge. (Please feel free to message friends in the guild chat and establish those lines of communication, too!)\n\nThe current plan is to **continue running the monthly challenges for as long as I have the gems for them.** After that, a permanent challenge will be created for anyone who likes the tasks and wants to take them on. There will be no end date for this new challenge, it's just a place to park our beautifully worded stabs into the cosmos.\n\nGuild challenges:\n\nCleanup: https://habitica.com/challenges/2c59def1-3f2f-45b1-a3c6-0eeff3a552fd  \n\nClean Every Day: https://habitica.com/challenges/934eeb5a-ec94-4293-8843-b6650bb9c7ec  \n\nStudy: https://habitica.com/challenges/716e4861-cdc8-4fe6-b2d5-0a844bb45e5e  \n\nThank you to our founder @Limenea for starting this group!

You've come to the right place!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## What makes a good TIL?\n\n- It should be a fact which other people can learn from you, not just a statement that you've learned something. So instead of \"TIL about fish\", you'd need to tell us *what* you learned about fish. This isn't your homework report.\n\n- It should be a fact, and not personal experience or something that is only true for you. \"TIL that I like carrots\", for example -- we're happy for you, but that's not a fact that would help in a general knowledge quiz!\n\n- It shouldn't just be an opinion.\n\n- Ideally, you should be able to provide a source so we can look up more information for ourselves. \n\nPosts which do not meet these guidelines will be deleted without comment.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Examples\n\nHere are some past TILs that might help you get an idea of what to post!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- @thersalynx: \"TIL that if one person has already an (emotional favored) opinion about a topic, he or she is most likely to search for information (or to filter statements) which underlines the opinion instead of being open to new perspectives. This tendency is called confirmation bias. Source: \"Psychology of learning and motivation\" vol. 32, 1995: \"Varieties of confirmation bias\", by Joshua Klayman\"\n\n- @Tyron A'Surus, King: \"TIL hippos make their own sunscreen. Hippos have glands under their skin that secret two substances that mix to create a thick oily reddish-orange sunscreen. It not only blocks untraviolet light, but also serves as an antibiotic (because male hippos gouge each other). This secretion also given rise to a false internet rumor that hippos have pink/red milk and sweat. https://asknature.org/strategy/secretion-protects-skin/\"\n\n- @shanaqui: \"TIL that there were enormous fungi in the Devonian period -- perhaps as tall as a two-storey house. It was initially assumed that the fossil structures were tree trunks due to their size, but isotopic analysis strongly points to the behaviour of a saprotrophic fungus.

Let's do it together.

Let the Guild know, and share the love! :heartpulse:\n\n---\n\n\nChoose Your Partner Every Day  ~ written by Bryan Reeves\n\n\n*\"I spent 5 years hurting a good woman by staying with her but never fully choosing her.*\n\n\n*I did want to be with this one. I really wanted to choose her. She was an exquisite woman, brilliant and funny and sexy and sensual. She could make my whole body laugh with her quick, dark wit and short-circuit my brain with her exotic beauty. Waking up every morning with her snuggled in my arms was my happy place. I loved her wildly.*\n\n\n*Unfortunately, as happens with many young couples, our ignorance of how to do love well quickly created stressful challenges in our relationship. Before long, once my early morning blissful reverie gave way to the strained, immature ways of our everyday life together, I would often wonder if there was another woman out there who was easier to love, and who could love me better.*\n\n\n*As the months passed and that thought reverberated more and more through my head, I chose her less and less. Every day, for five years, I chose her a little less.*\n\n\n*I stayed with her. I just stopped choosing her. We both suffered. Choosing her would have meant focusing every day on the gifts she was bringing into my life that I could be grateful for: her laughter, beauty, sensuality, playfulness, companionship, and so … much … more.*\n\n\n*Sadly, I often found it nearly impossible to embrace – or even see – what was so wildly wonderful about her.*\n\n\n*I was too focused on the anger, insecurities, demands, and other aspects of her strong personality that grated on me. The more I focused on her worst, the more I saw of it, and the more I mirrored it back to her by offering my own worst behavior. Naturally, this only magnified the strain on our relationship … which still made me choose her even less.*\n\n\n*Thus did our nasty death spiral play itself out over five years. She fought hard to make me choose her. That’s a fool’s task. You can’t make someone choose you, even when they might love you. To be fair, she didn’t fully choose me, either. The rage-fueled invective she often hurled at me was evidence enough of that. I realize now, however, that she was often angry because she didn’t feel safe with me. She felt me not choosing her every day, in my words and my actions, and she was afraid I would abandon her.*\n\n\n*Actually, I did abandon her.*\n\n\n*By not fully choosing her every day for five years, by focusing on what bothered me rather than what I adored about her, I deserted her.*\n\n\n*Like a precious fragrant flower I brought proudly into my home but then failed to water, I left her alone in countless ways to wither in the dry hot heat of our intimate relationship.*\n*I’ll never not choose another woman I love again.*\n*It’s torture for everyone.*\n\n\n*If you’re in relationship, I invite you to ask yourself this question:*\n*“Why am I choosing my partner today?”*\n\n\n*If you can’t find a satisfying answer, dig deeper and find one. It could be as simple as noticing that in your deepest heart’s truth, “I just do.”*\n\n\n*If you can’t find it today, ask yourself again tomorrow. We all have disconnected days.*\n\n\n*But if too many days go by and you just can’t connect with why you’re choosing your partner, and your relationship is rife with stress, let them go. Create the opening for another human being to show up and see them with fresh eyes and a yearning heart that will enthusiastically choose them every day.*\n\n\n*Your loved one deserves to be enthusiastically chosen. Every day.*\n*You do, too.*\n\n\n*Choose wisely.\"*",

The project idea has now expanded to other animals and researchers. The rebooted version of their site can be found at zooniverse.org/\n\nAll you have to do to help is go to Zooniverse.org, make an account, find a project, and start tagging! You can register as a volunteer freely at 18+ or with parent's permission if you are a minor. \n\nThere are several different fields of study to help with including nature, medicine, biology,  space, and climate. You can search through them with different tags including most recently launched, most in need of volunteers, and most recently updated.\n\nFor an idea of some of the possible projects you can help with;\n\nThe current top twenty projects in need of volunteers are: (Since January)\n\n1. [Spider Crab Watch](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/spidercrabwatch/spider-crab-watch) - Three task sets bundled under the same project! Crabtastic, the primary feature of the study you will tag any spider crabs or crab remains in the image. There are also two other tasks sets, one of spotting other marine life, and one for spotting human interaction!\n\n2. [Iguanas from Above](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/andreavarela89/iguanas-from-above) - Tagging Marine Iguanas from aerial footage! You will also mark down other Galapagos flora and fauna in this task set. Additionally, this project marks areas of plastic waste and litter in need of clean up as well.\n\n3. [Planet Four](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/mschwamb/planet-four) - Mark blotches on the surface of planet Mars to help better understand its climate.\n\n4. [Genome Detectives](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/charrod/genome-detectives) - Decode DNA to better understand infectious diseases.\n\n5. [South Coast Threatened Fauna Recovery Project](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/abbsta/south-coast-threatened-fauna-recovery-project) - Australian Wildlife project focused particularly on Gilbert's Potoroo and the Western Ground Parrot- rarest mammal and bird respectively. \n\n6.

[People's Contest Digital Archive](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/kmc35/peoples-contest-digital-archive)\n\nBig thanks to @CathB for compiling the links for me!\n\n-\n\nI have been hosting this challenge since June 2019 and will continue to do so until I run out of gems! And after I run out of gems I can still have the guild challenge but with no prize. ;3\n\nIf anyone has any ideas how I can improve and add to this challenge, feel free to DM me or post in the guild. This could include other conservation projects people can pitch in, informative articles or videos on a particular species, books to read, etc. Or just if you come across and especially fun photo while tagging zooniverse images.\n\n",

      "description":"This guild is to prepare for a pleasant Christmas Holiday with thoughtful gifts within budget and sent out Christmas cards before Christmas. Lots of lovely decorations and plenty of homemade Christmas treats.  The trick is to start late October and work on it a little at a time everyday.

The tasks were usually small and aimed at self-care, connection and fun (like taking a bubble bath, trying something new, donating to a food bank, etc), and guild members often chatted about their tasks and how things were going.\n\nThe challenges are over now, and shanaqui has stepped away; the New Year Countdown Fairy has gone to sleep and won't wake up anymore. They have not given anyone their blessing to take over the challenge series, and would appreciate if everyone would respect that choice.\n\nAll that said, the guild is open for challenge creation and for chatter.

A list of the challenges broken into categories can be found on our [Wiki](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/The_Keep:Library_of_Tasks_and_Challenges). \n\nTherefore, the Library challenges are usually permanent (without planned end, winner, or prize). They are meant less for participating (though that is possible as well) and more for copying their tasks and customizing them for yourself.\n\nFuture lists could include scenarios like GTD, Homemaking, Freelancing, Writing, Musicians, Students, etc. as well as a main Library of Goals, and a Gamified Library.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTo add tasks from a Library challenge to your lists: \n1. **Join** the challenge. \n2. Then **leave** the challenge, choosing the *Keep Tasks* option.\n3. The tasks are now your own, and no longer linked to the challenge. You can customize them to your liking, change them and delete those you don't want.\n\nHave your own set of tasks you want to share? \n\nJust add a  new challenge to this guild, or discuss ideas in guild chat! Feel free to browse or add challenges to our [Guild Wiki](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/The_Keep:Library_of_Tasks_and_Challenges)!\n\nPlease keep all submissions friendly to all ages. \n\nThere are also various wiki pages containing a wealth of sample tasks - for example, [Sample Habits](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Sample_Habits), [Sample Dailies](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Sample_Dailies), [Sample To-Dos](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Sample_To-Dos), [Sample Custom Rewards](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Sample_Custom_Rewards), [Sample Tags](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Sample_Tags), [Gamifying Your Lists](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Gamifying_Your_Lists), and [Habitican Shared Task Lists](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Habitican_Shared_Task_Lists).\n\n______________________________________________\n\nNote - to keep this guild as useful as possible, we're trying our best to limit the number of people subscribed to the guild under 5000 so that notifications are readily available. Every few months, we'll do a quick purge of guild members who haven't logged in for at least 2 months. If you get kicked out, you're welcome to rejoin when you return to Habitica!",

You look around you and see other people (guild members) looking as confused as you are. What will you do?}  \nplease note any rude comments, swearing, bullying, starting violence without asking me, and killing other members will result in a Kick/Warning.  \nplease PM me your character info so we can start!  \n  Character info\n@Spottedtail_warrior aka Kristy: A short 13-year-old with dark brown long hair and blue-green eyes. Slightly annoying, tries to help people but usually messes up. daughter of Hadis and Persephone. (She does not know this)\nName: Bunny8000 AKA Despina\nGender: female\nPersonality: hot-tempered, clever, witty, arrogant\nAge: 13\nAppearance: (human): brown hair, grey eyes (rabbit): brown fur, grey eyes\nDespina is the daughter of Ares and Aphrodite (unknowingly, of course), and can turn into a speaking rabbit (though doesn’t realize this until she knows that Aphrodite and Ares and her parents).  \n\n@BattleOfTheWarwings AKA:  Atychis. A male wolf who used to be the demigod son of some minor god, husband of a beautiful water nymph named Asimallia who had flowing silver hair.

She has flowing, dark blue hair that seems to be emitting a faint glow, ocean blue eyes with gold flecks, magpie wings+tail+feet. She wears a gray hoodie and black jeans, no shoes. She was human, but was cursed by Apollo to become a harpy, because her mother (not knowing he was Apollo) said he was Voo-doo and a useless father that always disappears and keeps on tracking Apollo. Her mother caught Apollo and another woman, in anger, Apollo wiped her mother's existence off the world and also cursed twilight to be a harpy.\n",

      "description":"This guild contains challenges where a route (real or fantasy) has been made into an imaginary/virtual journey that can be performed anywhere. The milestones will serve as goals for one's own exercising (walking, swimming, bicycling, rowing, cayaking, canoeing, skiing or other activities that makes one move from A to B). The important goal of the challenges is to help people be physically active. Choose the activity/activities you like the best to reach the goal of the challenges.  \n  \nWhen the daily says \"Make progress in the journey from A to B\", it's up to you to decide the limit for when you can check it of or not. If you want to check it of it of when you've moved 0,5 km/0,3 miles during the day, that's OK. If you want to reach for instance 3 km or 3 miles for instance, before checking of the daily, that's also OK. We are different, and it's fine to do the journeys in the pace one prefers and can manage. The goal *isn't* to reach the finish line *first*, but to get to the finish line. :smile: **Important note:** If you don't want the daily tasks, you can leave the challenge and choose to keep the tasks. The tasks will become non-challenge tasks and you can edit and delete them as desired. (There **won't** be any winners of the challenges anyway (except in rare occations in specified challenges), so there's no winning chance to loose by leaving a challenge and keeping the tasks.) For the challenge which don't have dailies, you can add dailies youself if you want to.  \n  \nThe distances given in the to-dos do always refer to the total distance from the starting point of the challenge. So if to-do 1 says \"reach 10 km\", to-do 2 says \"reach 25 km\" and to-do 3 says \"reach 43 km\", 10, 25 and 43 km means that you have to move 10 km to reach the first milestone, 25 km in total to reach the second milestone and 43 km in total to reach the third milestone. **Not** ~~10 km~~, ~~10+25=35 km~~ and ~~10+25+43=78 km~~. The challenge description (and the list in this guild desciption) will tell how long each challenge is. Compare the given distance to the last to-do in the challenge, and you'll see that the distance in that to-do and the distance in the description match. The last to-do tell the total distance you have to move to complete the challenge.   \n  \nTo track the distance you've moved, feel free to use whichever tool you find most convenient. Apps for your phone/smart watch, a step counter to carry in your pocket, Google maps for instance.  \n  \nThe challenges will mostly be neverending challenges without a gem prize. My hope is that the in-game rewards and the satisfaction of making progress in an imaginary journey is a good enough reward. Feel free to add checklist items to each to-do to get a higher reward per to-do. \n  \nSearch terms: Challenges, imaginary journeys, virtual, fitness, exercise, exercising, walking, hike, hiking, jogging, running, swimming, bicycle, bicycling, rowing, cayaking, canoeing, skiing, nature, outdoors, active, activity, health, weight loss, weight maintainance.  \nFeel free to suggest other search terms!\n  \nMore challenges will be added to the guild. I'll add challenges based on routes both in Norway and in other countries. Feel free to make suggestions, especially with a link that provides distances that can be used as sub-goals in the challenge. You can also create challenges yourself, as long as they fit the theme of the guild. You can use the guild [The Challenge Sandbox](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/0cb00017-4074-435d-8b6d-717fabd7d492) to create a challenge, and move it to this guild later. When using The Challenge Sandbox to create a challenge, you can spend as much time as you need on building the challenge, without fearing that someone will join an incomplete challenge.  \n  \nThe challenges in the guild:  \n  \nMulti-country:  \n+ [Orient Express Walking/Running/Biking Challenge](https://habitica.com/challenges/91d3ff09-a9a4-4fce-b754-c3974e96bb73) (3524,46km/2190 miles)\n  \nUnited States of America (USA):\n+ [The Appalachian Trail](https://habitica.com/challenges/549fe89b-7e46-4757-b830-d6753eebd9ac) (3,531 km/2,194 miles)\n+ [American Gods the Exercise Challenge](https://habitica.com/challenges/f2d341e8-fbde-4011-979a-bfcd05bc949b) (WORK IN PROGRESS) (6076 km/3776 miles)\n  \nSolar System:\n+ [A Trip through the Solar System - Exercise Challenge](https://habitica.com/challenges/3e1da99c-b575-41f1-b038-5a5bd236f4b3) (5906 km/3670 miles **or** 963,2 km/598,3 miles) ",

All challenges include multiple milestones based on the distances from EowynChallenge.net. These challenges run for the whole year and a new set is posted at the start of the next one. If the year turns over while you're walking, pick up where you were.\n\n### **Join in at any time!**\n\n## Daily and Habit Tasks\n\nThe dailies and habit tasks created for the guild challenges can be found in a separate challenge that will stay open for the whole year and will therefore keep these tasks in your list regardless of where you are in the walk.  It will close at the end of the year when a prize will be awarded for the best role-playing. \n- [Dailies and Habit](https://habitica.com/challenges/283d2fad-0b67-4718-a762-6fc1013709ae).\n\n## Main Challenge\n\nThe main challenge follows Sam and Frodo to destroy the ring and return.  Distances on the milestones are only for that leg of the journey.  \n\n### **To be eligible for a gem prize at the end of the year you must post periodic updates on your progress in this guild!**  \n\nThis walk is broken down into different legs and one bonus:\n- [Leg 1: Hobbiton to Rivendell](https://habitica.com/challenges/ad10568d-c7d7-4b33-8dab-bc55c3882eb6). \n- [Leg 2: Rivendell to Lothlórien](https://habitica.com/challenges/fcfebfa1-5083-4bc8-bec0-59b9990b8076). \n- [Leg 3: Lothlórien to Rauros](https://habitica.com/challenges/ca2fb4c8-9e6d-47ac-8505-90e195a803ca). \n- [Leg 4: Rauros to Mount Doom](https://habitica.com/challenges/62f8b735-d8eb-4e67-8acb-c993236d63da).   \n- [Leg 5: Morannon to Minas Tirith](https://habitica.com/challenges/f0344995-43a9-47fc-9366-dcc50f731e78).   \n- [Leg 6: Minas Tirith to Isengard](https://habitica.com/challenges/9ae2fa0f-79a1-4753-8d80-b5d72c167f47). \n- [Leg 7: Isengard to Rivendell](https://habitica.com/challenges/3173a068-2caa-44ae-9324-f13324239378). \n- [Leg 8: Rivendell to Bag End](https://habitica.com/challenges/180d27f7-7aed-4a39-bfbe-c21fad14cac9). \n- [Leg 9: Bag End to the Grey Havens](https://habitica.com/challenges/5c8cac3b-0cb5-45ea-8eb0-770252d9418b). \n- [Bonus 1: Sam's Journey Home](https://habitica.com/challenges/29160175-08df-41e8-9b9e-fa4895da682d). \n\n## Alternate Paths\n\nFor those who want to walk more, or who prefer to take a different path in the middle, several have been created:  \n[Alt 1: Aragorn's journey from Rauros to Isengard](https://habitica.com/challenges/78f8c037-21ca-4897-a336-38ba482d8180).   \n[Alt 2: Aragorn's journey from Isengard to Minas Tirith](https://habitica.com/challenges/ba9729f0-b654-4280-b20f-3d3ea4f0c772).   \n[Alt 2a: Merry's journey from Isengard to Minas Tirith](https://habitica.com/challenges/14592ed1-4fae-41fe-abd9-0fe3be179b95).   \n[Alt 3: Aragorn's journey from Minas Tirith to the Morannon](https://habitica.com/challenges/e24e84de-e718-442f-adcb-911665164960).   \n\nThere is another possible alternate path:\n- Rauros to Isengard, (Merry & Pippin) - this makes little sense unless you are a hobbit as the orcs were only ordered to take hobbits with them, therefore it has not been created this year.  If this is a problem, PM the guild leader \n \n\n## Looking for more Middle-earth walks?\n\nWe have a Hobbit Walk challenge with a gem prize - [Hobbiton to the Lonely Mountain](https://habitica.com/challenges/12c9f747-1d33-4a3a-9e56-fe92213d52f9).    \nAnd just to round things off nicely we have [Bilbo's journey home from the Lonely Mountain](https://habitica.com/challenges/aabed73c-30a2-43bd-97db-284a9556ee24)     \nCathB also has a Hobbit Walk challenge without a gem prize with one copy posted here [The Hobbit](https://habitica.com/challenges/e5c3c36a-5cd3-4ffa-904c-a6246e9cb04d) and another in the [Imaginary journey challenges guild](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/ae6d97f3-4dd2-42af-a23b-23099402f50d). \n\n## Related Guilds\n\n[Bag End](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/17be5511-29e1-4dc8-9ef9-f06ce4c9f6f1).\n\n[Narnians](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/a5ee12a8-4ad8-40ab-9155-5fcece2ae331).\n\n[Imaginary/virtual journeys](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/ae6d97f3-4dd2-42af-a23b-23099402f50d).\n",

      "description":"Go is an abstract strategy board game for two players in which the aim is to surround more territory than the opponent. The game was invented in China more than 2,500 years ago and is believed to be the oldest board game continuously played to the present day.\n\n------------\n![game go](https://www.kcpinternational.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/50192373658_e273a108a8_c.jpg)\n\n----\n# Free reading\n\nIf you have an Apple device, you can install a free app called \"Go Books\" where you'll have access to a free chapter of each book and if you want, even buy it from them (in-app purchase). This is a good way to see if you like the book. If you want a print version, a lot of books are available online.  The books \"Learn to Play Go: A Master's Guide to the Ultimate Game Volume 1\" and \"Go: A Complete Introduction to the Game\" both look helpful books to learn from as well. (´･ᴗ･ ` ) You can also use the website [https://www.learn-go.net/](https://www.learn-go.net/) to learn from.\n\n![anime game](http://pm1.narvii.com/6370/64e5c7905a9259a89fc7fe9e9079b549da657efe_00.jpg)\n\n\n# Anime\n\nThere's an old anime called \"Hikaru no Go\" about this board game! It's from 2001 with 75 episodes. You don't have to watch everything. Watching the first one might get you interested in the game (or simply introduce it so that you know how big the professional board is, who goes first, etc.) I watched the first episode here: [https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5jiu6o](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5jiu6o).\n\nThis guild was created as a result of a challenge in February - March 2021. \n\n# Playing Games\n\nAgainst a computer: https://www.cosumi.net/en/ small, big boards -- up to you.\n\nAgainst a human being: https://www.playok.com/en/go/ -- register or play as guest. \n\n# Solving Go Puzzles \n\n [https://tsumego-hero.com/](https://tsumego-hero.com/) is a nice website to solve them; free to sign up -- has a level up feature like Habitica :)\n\n# Sharing pictures\n\nIf you would like to share some pictures of your games, here's how to do it: \n\n!

Reading is my favorite thing to do, I read every day. I'm also a writer working on lots of short stories and one novella. I'm very into witchcraft and the occult and I am currently studying buddhism. I'm a college student and that's very important to me.... Finally I love all things that open your mind and expand your perspectives on things, deeper conversation and metaphysics and such. Is love to meet some of you through letters!) [want to stay on the list 1-23-23]",

In this guild, we try to create new, creative ways to use/play Habitica, by creating special rules for our tasks. Curious? Feel free to take a look and ask!\n\n&#160;\n\nIn this guild, everyone can create their [self-imposed challenges](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Self-Imposed_Challenges) to share how they modify their game! It is important to note that these challenges do not impact the game directly, instead, it gives the players special rules to make the game more interesting and fun! If you want to create one of these challenges, it is advisable to insert the [\"Challenge Information Form\"](https://pastebin.com/raw/2FXTDEwY) in the description of the challenge.\n\n&#160;\n\nAlso before you join a challenge, you should separate your actual task from the challenge's task with [tags](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Tags). Your tasks list can get very messy if you don't manage it properly.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n### **Story Mode**\n\n### Currently on hiatus\n\n### **[Story Mode : Explore the abandoned temple](https://habitica.com/challenges/5eb4df73-13dd-488d-8c1a-faf962af0307)**\n\n![Temple](https://i.imgur.com/3rLlXMu.png)\n\n--\n\n### **Allied Guilds**\n\n[**Hard Mode**](https://habitica.com/#/options/groups/guilds/bb4fe1e3-b7fa-4aa6-878b-1ecef0ca55f3): Feeling that the game is too easy?

Be a mercenary and sell your time to whoever you please or a client and request help from them.\n\n[**Challenge sandbox**](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/0cb00017-4074-435d-8b6d-717fabd7d492): A place to build challenges slowly, without danger of anyone joining them before they are ready.

      "description":"This guild is dedicated to all those who are recovering from alcoholism.  Together, we can do what we cannot do alone.  Members of 12-step groups are welcome as long as the discussion stays directed to our problems with alcohol.\n\nThis isn't an actual group of Alcoholics Anonymous, but rather a way of encouraging Habitica users to work a good program.  If in doubt: Get to a meeting!  Read the Big Book!  Call your Sponsor!\n\n\"Acceptance is the answer to all my problems today. When I am disturbed, it is because I find some person, place, thing, or situation—some fact of my life—unacceptable to me, and I can find no serenity until I accept that person, place, thing, or situation as being exactly the way it is supposed to be at this moment. Nothing, absolutely nothing, happens in God’s world by mistake. Until I could accept my alcoholism, I could not stay sober; unless I accept life completely on life’s terms, I cannot be happy. I need to concentrate not so much on what needs to be changed in the world as on what needs to be changed in me and in my attitudes.\"  -Big Book 4th ed, pg 419.\n\nWe are here to support those who seek guidance and fellowship in recovery,  as well as supporting your growth with new habits!\n\nThanks for participating!\n\n**Keep Coming Back!**\n\nFor online meeting support, go to: https://www.aa.org",

      "description":"I made this because most of the interests I have are niche and small communities that do things in ways other people don't do. I can bear witness the success of less popular works that never make it big merely because they're unpopular. Popularity has a giant hurdle that can only be crossed today with money, but, money is limited. You can try to control the value of money, but, you'll only decrease scarcity and demand for commodities. Because of this, it's better instead of keep niche communities alive even if they're not receiving attention through the process of collectivism based consolidation.\n\nThis guild doesn't make anything a duty. You don't have to do what you don't want to do, but, if you want to do something that nobody else wants to do, then by all means challenge people. Nobody wants to watch the entire series of highlander without being told it even exists, but, if you want to watch highlander, then make it a challenge not just for yourself, but anybody who stumbles across it as well. This is how I hope to bring attention to niche communities that don't normally get any attention what so ever.\n\nIf you would like to join a discord which might draw some traction around for things you want noticed, then here's the link.\n\nhttps://discord.gg/xsc26GYVzQ\n\nA couple of final notes. There are 365 days in a year and 3640 experience requirement to level 100 on habitica. Trivial tasks give 1 experience, easy tasks give 6 experience, medium tasks give 9 experience, and hard tasks give 12 experience. The more those tasks are completed both by yourself or inside of a challenge, the less experience they will give, dropping down to 2/3rds their base experience. Consider this when designing a challenge that depends on certain time goals you set for yourself when thinking about what someone should be doing on an average day. If you want to make your challenge around level 100, then be sure to specify that in the challenge details to give people an idea about how much experience they can get from your challenge. If you have no level goals, then be sure to specify that in your challenge. Level 200 is slightly more than three times as much in requirements for experience than level 100, while level 300 is twice as much experience requirement than level 200. The formula for experience requirements for level goals is below.\n\n0.25*<Level>^2+10*<Level>+139.75\n\nThis formula is argued by many to not be accurate, however, it doesn't have to be pretty as long as your intention was known. These goals that I would like to see people set aren't goals that are expected to be popular. I'll create a starting challenge and hopefully others take it from there. The starting challenge will have a format that others can learn from and use for their own challenges. I encourage others to use other guilds for things that there's already a guild for, but, if you don't know, then by all means talk in the discord about it with others. If you can't make your challenge in the guild you admire, than do it here. I would also really encourage people to express themselves about what they wish could be done with concepts that are original which you can almost only find inside of small niche communities that don't get the attention of the general population or attention isn't given to it by people who control the attention of the general population.",

Heads turn and bodies spring into action before conscious thought kicks in.  We all know that feeling -- that rush of adrenaline, a touch of fear mingled with excitement, the sense of urgency and purpose.  It's a calling, a need, a  passion.   We are on the front lines of daily life.  We are the siblings in uniforms around the world.  We are the past, the present, and the future of emergency response.  We share in the tears, revel in the laughter, swap stories.  We are the keepers of secrets; we have held lives in our hands.\n  \nWe are the first responders of Habitica, and of the world.  \n  \nWe're not exclusive to police, fire, or EMS personnel, either.  Everyone is welcome, as long as your interest in emergency services is genuine.   We're all in the game of life, playing by hard and fast rules that amount to protecting and aiding the people of the world.   Whether you're retired or looking to make a career, whether you're a volunteer or have dedicated your life and career to the cause, come and be welcome.   \n  \nRemember that this is a public guild and as such we are bound by the public forum policies  as well as privacy laws.  Stories are welcome, but try to keep them as clean as possible.  \n  \n**Oh, and Rule Number One:  We don't use the Q Word in here.**  \n\n",

There are other things we can do to make a major difference in our lives, one week at a time.  \n\n\n\nThis guild is a place to create and participate in those challenges.  Make a difference in your life or in the lives of others.  Create the challenge here, or merely announce a weekly challenge from another guild in this space.  Challenges can be weekly or monthly.  Annual challenges with 52 items to achieve are allowed but not encouraged, as it is far too easy to get behind and then give up.  The focus is taking small steps to make a big difference.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe really great things about 52 weeks - do what you can do THIS week.  If you can't participate as much next week (for whatever reason), don't.  Join the challenges as you can and as you need to.  Let the other's go.  (And if you cannot complete a challenge in a given week, but you really want to complete that week's challenge, join then leave - but keep the tasks.  Then you can change the active days on the dailies, discard a few of the to dos, modify it anyway you want for a future purpose.)\n\n\n\nJoin in!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn an effort to put my efforts where they are useful I have created a [poll](https://goo.gl/ZwvzhR).

Upload it to an image sharing site (e.g. [snipboard](https://snipboard.io), [imgur](https://imgur.com), [photobucket](https://photobucket.com)).\n   3. Post the image in the chat using [markdown](https://habitrpg.wikia.com/wiki/Markdown_Cheat_Sheet): `![optional description](http://i.imgur.com/imagename.png)`\n- If you wish to, post the items that make up the avatar.

Welcome!\n\nIf you're **new to Rising Heroes** as well, you'll want to join the [Onboarding Missions\nChallenge](https://habitica.com/#/options/groups/challenges/1512e560-d017-4a7d-bfb8-8c40fb65a9ed) to\nget Tasks for each of the Onboarding Missions that Rebel One has given you. These are all To-Dos\nthat will be added to your Tasks page when you join the Challenge.\n\nIf, meanwhile, you're **new to Habitica**, you'll want to visit the [Habitica\nWiki](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Habitica_Wiki). The home page there has a neat little Getting\nStarted guide, and links to plenty more resources for newbies. There's also a Guild where you can\nhave all your questions about Habitica answered: the [Habitica\nHelp](https://habitica.com/#/options/groups/guilds/5481ccf3-5d2d-48a9-a871-70a7380cee5a) guild,\nformerly \"The Newbies Guild\". Although people here in the RH Guild are usually happy to answer the\noccasional question too!\n\n---\n\n### Permanent Challenges:\n\n[Onboarding Missions](https://habitica.com/#/options/groups/challenges/1512e560-d017-4a7d-bfb8-8c40fb65a9ed)\n\n[Reminders, rewards and punishments](https://habitica.com/#/options/groups/challenges/40e986da-832d-4e90-a52d-03f0d2f95234)\n(Carrots and sticks)\n\n#### A note on Challenge links\n\nThe links above take you to the Challenge pages on [Habitica.com](https://habitica.com), even if you\ntap them in the mobile apps. This is because there's no neat way to link to Challenges within the\nAndroid app yet, and the iOS app doesn't have a Challenges section at all! The easiest way to join\nthe Challenges is still just to go to the website (you may need to login). Once you've clicked the\nbig green **Join** button, the Tasks will be added to your Tasks page, and *will* turn up in the app!\n\n## *For the Rebellion!*\n\n---\n\n### Guild rules\n\nLooking for group is fine, but keep it RH-themed. There's a Looking for Group Guild you can go to\nfor non-RH Parties.\n\nIt is ok to be proud of your faction, it is not ok to put down other factions (except those people who used to call themselves the 5th Faction! Boooo!).\n\nYou can look for a wing-person here if you want. It is slightly more specific than the [Facebook\ngroup](https://www.facebook.com/groups/RisingHeroes/).\n\n---\n\n### Other Guilds\n\nThere are currently two other RH-themed Guilds, one for\n[Havik](https://habitica.com/#/options/groups/guilds/4c831743-d63d-4584-a69b-5ba4ccacc648) and one\nfor [Tyrus](https://habitica.com/#/options/groups/guilds/94ff685a-9651-4f90-b775-4c017946a2ea).

Micah 6:8 NKJV. Today I was reminded for the πth time that God is ever present and ready for my every move and thought, and in spite of my lazy slumber, had a plan to stir me up again (more on this later) Big thanks and many blessings to the founders of this guild and all its inhabitants heart. Ready to walk again.\n* ``@TheMightyMcGrew``\n\n🕊️ I was blessed by the Tongue Talkers challenge this month! It helped me to sense the truth that the Lord is near, and full of grace. My mood and my hope were built up, seemingly in proportion to using the gift. I know in my head that He is always near, but that gift helps me open my spirit too Him, I am reminded, in my inner self, that He is. His fellowship - and faith that He is there - is so critical to my well being. I have not used this gift much at all, and this challenge hopefully I will take as a stepping stone to continuing. A huge **THANK YOU** to [@Plesioth](/profile/ceaac697-7373-4a38-a364-0e34dbc873bb), you are making a difference!\n* ``@Rrebecca``\n\n🕊️ To share about my thoughts this month as part of the Tongue Talkers challenge: I find that when I use this gift, I am mostly bringing and unloading / dumping my anxieties and stressors. But, unlike when we do this to people, just using them to complain or vent, needing to be heard, regardless of whether they are weary of listening - the Lord really, really wants to hear these things that are heavy in my heart. And unlike a human listener, He can truly lighten my load as I learn to trust that He heard me ask Him to take care of everything, and he is able to do so. It's much more freeing, and cleaner than meditating - by this I mean seeing oneself as distinct from, or divesting oneself of, stressors until all that's left is a central self at \"rest\" - but without taking that dangerous step of stepping outside oneself in order to picture the stressors as separate. We are instead, centered in reality which includes our real pain and trials, and without a trace of disassociation, lifting up our cares to the Lord, who cares for us. This is not a discipline of divestment but instead it is simply being His little child, doing what we need to do - and what we want to do most when we are humble - to pour out our hearts to the One who cares. Abraham Wright said, in Psalms, by Spurgeon, \"The committing of our cause to God is at once or duty, our safety, and or ease.\"\nAnd then the next thought that came to me was: This is not only for my benefit of receiving the peace of the Lord. It is also an act of intersession. Everything that distresses me also distresses the Lord. So I get to be someone who transmits that pain into His hands, where (alone) it can be redeemed. In this way, by casting our cares upon the Lord, we get to be His agents, of calling upon Him for His Kingdom to come in every single thing that is wrong on Earth right now. We are like little Roombas of problems, not that he would want any of His people to suffer. It is not that we can redeem sin or do we have any power of our own. But He has granted that faith - this lifting of burdens to Him to take care of - has a power for redemption. When we give burdens to God, we see Him working His redemption in those areas. (Of course He can act to redeem without our prayers, but He is looking to find faith on Earth.) So when we suffer in small or large ways, it is as people who can carry that pain to Him for redemption.\nIt goes without say that all of this is true regardless of whether we pray in a tongue given to us, or in our learned human language. But there in Tongue Talking a gracious open door that makes prayer easier, as the Holy Spirit prays for us with \"groans too deep for words\" when we don't know how to pray.\n* by ``@Rrebecca``\n``@DoctorMikeC``\n* 🕊️Love that this group encourages speaking in tongues!\n* ``@ChiefChips``\n[@Plesioth](/profile/ceaac697-7373-4a38-a364-0e34dbc873bb) Thanks Plesioth for the effort you put and for continuing this guild; it motivates me to read the Scriptures a bit more and pushes me to share what I read with others, God Bless!\n\n\n\n![ImageGenesis9,15](https://i.ibb.co/ZdG1GHy/Genesis-9-15.png)\n___\n___\n___\n___\n\n![](https://ibb.co/b6pXx80)\n___\n\n\n___\n# Scripture Comments\n![ImageEphesians 2, 8](https://i.ibb.co/gM1zfbh/Ephesians-2-8.png)\n``@LadyJuliana``\n*\"Ephesians 2--summarizes salvation in the first 10 verses!*\n\n*1--I was dead.

Or I think of what God told Job. \"can you even comprehend what I do\".....*\n___\n``@Theonidas``\n2 Peter 2. This one is strong! A stern warning of false teachers. These are who arose within the church, secretly bring in destructive heresies, having 'Forsaken the right way' and are deceiving the church with their 'loud boasts of folly'. There is quite a graphic description of these false teachers. One may think this is too harsh. But we see such manner of false teachers today. Many self-proclaimed prophets and apostles, pastors, teachers, evangelists whose message is that of mere fleshly pleasure, self-gratification, increasing personal wealth, exchanging the glorious Gospel of Jesus Christ for physical wellness and prosperity on earth.\n\nThey show clearly that their affections are for the things that God can (and does) give rather than for God Himself. They, in their lust for the world reject God and are at enmity with God. (James 4:4 \"You adulterous people! Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.\") This is why their destruction is promised and exemplified in the accounts of Noah and of Sodom and Gomorrah.\n\nWe would do well to heed Peter's advice that comes at the end of this book to \"grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ\" 2 Peter 3:18. That means, dear friends, stay prayerfully, consistently and desperately plugged into God's Word, connect with Bible-believing Churches and stay in touch with other believers who know and love the Lord.\n___\n``@SweetestPea``\n@Plesioth my husband is a historian and whenever I get caught up in end times thinking he likes to remind me that every generation thought they were living in the end times at some point. I try to focus on the present moment being my “end time”, like waking up every morning and saying “Lord, this day is yours, how can I live today so that your kingdom will come on earth?” Not saying I do a good job of it, but it helps orient my day. The scary thing about the end times is things will get so hard we must be strong and wise enough to preserve in true faith, love and hope, so there is some urgency to growing in the Holy Spirit now. Also, that sinners who do not want to redeem may run out of time so to speak, and I worry about some relatives and people I know who live ungodly lives. Hearing about end times always reminds me I should be praying and seeking their conversion.\n___\n``@Kelly``\nReading this morning about Samuel anointing Saul.  Samuel told Saul he would be king and then told him all of the signs he would see on his journey back home.  Any one of these signs foretold should be enough to convince Saul he would be king.  It's interesting how many signs God is willing to show to prove to us we are supposed to take on large tasks.  God still does this for us today.  Particularly if we pray with faith and very specific prayers.  I know I've prayed before asking if God wanted me to follow a specific path.  I prayed that if so, He would have that group call me, so I would know it was His will.  That group called within 5 minutes, never having called me before.  God answers specific prayers.  We should be ready to go when He calls.\n___\n``@Charis``\nI'm not sure if it is weird to say it like this, but if you truly love someone would you feed them junkfood that taste delicious despite knowing the truth about how harmful it is or encourage them to try and accept fruits and vegetables that might taste tart or bitter knowing that it will help them grow? You can control your child's diet but not your friend's, but of course you care about them too. All you can do is share the information and let them choose. Even children grow up to make their own choices, so you can only hope that the good parts of their upbringing will stick with them even when they try \"junk food\".\n___\n``@Koltrast``\n1 Kings 8\n\nMy mind is pretty scattered today. With a big exam coming up tomorrow, I struggle to focus on my Bible. What stood out to me in this chapter, though, was that God sees the intentions of our hearts. David had his heart set on building a house for God, but God said it wasn't his to do. However, God also says David was right to have it in his heart. He sees our reasoning, our motivation, even when the results aren't what we, as humans, expect\n\n___\n``@Koltrast``\nPsalm 98:9(b) \"He will judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with equity\"\n\nEquity is such an interesting word. I like it far better than equality, because it implies there is consideration to the abilities of the individual. Equality means everybody gets the exact same, and no distinction is made. Equity means the individual needs and abilities are taken into consideration. God judges with equity. He has full knowledge of what our abilities are. He has full insight into our capabilities. He knows exactly the amount of strength required from each individual to do what he asks. He knows even better than we know ourselves. I will be judged with equity, not based on what this or that person could do.\n___\n``@LadyJuliana``\n*First of all, there is only one Way--one Truth, and one Life (John 14:6). In other words, there is only ONE person that can mediate between us and God--and that is Jesus (1 Timothy 2:5). To get wisdom from God, all we have to do is to ask Him. James 1:5 says, \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\" We don't have to go to anyone else, because we are ALL priests in God's eyes (1 Peter 2:5). No shaman can be any closer to God than Jesus, and He is the only way to the Father.*\n___\n``@Golden Earl``\n*Read 1 Corinthians Chapter 3. Several points from this chapter: When we do things for the glory of God, the good that results from it - \"increase\", comes from God, but for our labour, we will be given our reward accordingly. Only the foundation built on Jesus will last, and it will resist the fire that tests it, and we are a temple that God has given us. Last point is avoiding worldly wisdom which is foolishness in the sight of the Lord, and that if someone sees himself as wise, let him become  a fool so that he can truly become wise*\n____\n``@RemiNelo22``\n1 Corinthians 14 focuses on tongues and prophesy mainly. Verse 4 says that the man that prays in tongues edifies himself therefore grows spiritually.\n________\n``@IndigoFox`` *@SweetestPea there is a heavy distinction between 'a God who curses' and a god who is bad, I feel. God made children for Himself, made them just like Him, and then they were so easily led astray! He was frustrated with His children many times, and with his fallen servant who became a serpent specifically to decieve them. But when he got frustrated he often regretted it, and the ultimate form of this regret was sending his Son to put a permanent end to the cycle of vengence and regret. Many times He repented of His anger; perhaps tell your child how even God knows it's important to admit when you did something because you're angry but didn't mean it, and to try to make it right again.\n___\n``@Theonidas``\nStarting on the apostle Peter's second letter today. This book deals a lot with false prophets and false teachers in very vivid and strong words. Looking forward to maybe slowing down on this one to understand it better. \n\nIt begins in Chapter 1 with a reminder to Christians to practice virtue, knowledge, patience, godliness, self-control, brotherly kindness and love, as a response to the great and sure work of securing for us life and godliness, and of making us partakers of Jesus' divine nature. These qualities, Peter says, when practiced in addition to our faith, help us to be sure of our calling and election. \n\nIt is important to note that he is NOT saying that these qualities are what provide salvation and entry in to heaven ( vv3. His divine power has [already] GRANTED TO US all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the KNOWLEDG OF HIM who called us...). Remember this is peaking to Christians who have \"obtained a faith of equal standing with ours by the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ\". It is the knowledge of Christ, and belief in the saving works of his life, death and resurrection that save. Rather, he is saying practice these thing BECAUSE you have been saved and because you have all things to enable you to do so. \n\nHe mentions there will be \"richly provided for you an entrance into the eternal kingdom...\" I believe this is similar to what 1 John 2:28-29 is saying, where John speaks of having confidence in Him and not shrinking back at the time of his coming. It is a reminder to abide in Christ by practicing these virtues.\n\n_____\n___\n``@Rebecca``\n@plesioth thank you for creating the TongueTalking challenge! God graciously gave me the gift, but I have neglected it... And been drawn into the thorny cares of the world. You are motivating me! God bless you! And everyone else here.\n\n``@Rebecca``\n[@Plesioth](/profile/ceaac697-7373-4a38-a364-0e34dbc873bb) Re: \"sometimes it feels it's just an item on the list\"...  I know what you mean. I think that (or something similar) is the main reason I stopped and that many never really get going... Specifically, the idea of in my mind before I begin, \"I don't feel like doing this, I'm not feeling spritual or connected to God.\" And the next thought is, \"It would be fake for me to pretend.\" And then I have stopped before I begin. Ah-ha! Victory for the adversary, who wants us to think it's about us... our mood... our faithfulness... our giftedness... our intimacy! If I am vigilant I shall recognize the voice of the adversary. \n   Of course I don't need to be \"feeling spritual\" or even noticing a difference afterward... the sounds themselves are a sign that it's not about us.... The less I think about myself and the more I try (even if unsuccessfully) to focus in Him, the easier i think it is.\n\n___\n``@Haridnar``\nI read Genesis 1-3 today. There is so much in these three chapters that is foundational to the Christian faith and sets it apart. There is one God who created everything. He designed humanity to have a unique role in His creation. From the beginning, we were meant to have a close relationship with Him.\n___\n``@Haridnar``\nI read Genesis 2-4 this morning and was struck by the imagery of the rivers mentioned in chapter two. It describes how there is one river that flows out of Eden and divides into four lush rivers. The division into four suggests a completeness or wholeness since that is what the number four often symbolizes if I remember correctly, and a theme of Genesis is how Abraham will bless the nations. He, as a single source, will provide blessing to the whole world like the river from Eden. A more immediate significance of this dispersal to the world from one source comes in the Fall in the next chapter when the pollution of sin is spread to ask humanity through the single source of Adam (cf. Romans 5). The rivers are mentioned, I think, not just for geographical specificity but also for metaphorical thematic meaning.\n___\n``@Kohltrast``\nJeremiah 1, the call of Jeremiah. It’s so beautiful how the first thing God says when he calls Jeremiah, even before Jeremiah has a chance to protest is basically “listen, kiddo. I know you, and made you, and I’ve chosen you. You absolutely CAN do this.”\n___\n``@Haridnar``\nI read Genesis 16-18 this morning. I am struck by how involved Abraham and Sarah are in the act of hosting the Lord in chapter 18. He is a wealthy and old man yet he is running about giving orders (Sarah herself makes part of the meal) and serving rather than simply telling servants to work as normally happens in depictions of certain royal or wealthy people. There is also vivid detail of how he served his guests. \n\nI am also once more struck by how Abraham haggles with God for the lives of the righteous in Sodom.\n___\n``@SavvyKat``\nIn the short video lesson on today's verse, Hebrew 13:8, the speaker mentioned that in the Bible, Jesus always healed in different ways as a way to remind us to not rely on a certain formula but to rely on Jesus himself. That really spoke to me because as a kid, I always heard God speak to me in a very specific way, but these past two or three years, He no longer speaks to me in the same method. So I have been reeling and feeling lost because I could no longer hear God speak to me. I've tried to hear God's voice in other ways, but it's been hard, and so this message was just a good reminder to be open to all the ways God can speak to me instead of just relying on and expecting one way.\n___\n\n# Life Experience\n\n``@SavvyKat``\nToday's verse was 1 John 4:15. The accompanying study was about love, and a particular part stood out to me: \"Properly nurtured and exercised, love becomes full-grown, mature, visible---everyone can see and perceive it. This kind of love needs external expression to become mature. That's why Jesus said he give his disciples a new commandment to \"love one another as I have loved you.\"\n\nAll semester I have been trying to hang out with my best friend, but she is constantly busy and does not respond to my texts when I try to arrange a time to meet up. I don't really have a Christian fellowship to root into this semester cuz covid has shut a lot of stuff down and I am an introverted, out-of-state college student who has difficulty making connections. So my best friend is one of the few Christians I'm still connected to right now. But it's been really hard this semester not being able to talk with her like we used to. It hurts that she is not there for me anymore, that she ignores me even after I finally get up the courage to reach out to her (even with my close friends I have a hard time reaching out and asking for help). I was ready to give up on her and just call off our friendship, quietly distance myself from her because it was so painful that she was never around.\n\nBut then I read the devotional this morning, and I realised that this whole time I have  been looking at only what I need out if this relationship, only how she can love me. I haven't once stopped to truly consider how I can love her, and instead just assumed that our needs and wants were the same. I know now that they aren't.\n\nI want hours of deep conversation. I want late night walks. I want a set aside lunch together every week. I want her by my side as I do homework so that I can bounce ideas off her. Most of all I just want her attention, her time. But Christ-like love isn't about what I want, it's about what I can give.\n\nI'm not fully sure how best to love my friend right now. I don't fully know what she wants or needs. I want to give her my time because that's what I want from her in return. But maybe my time is not what she needs right now. Maybe the best way to love her right now is to just give her space to sort her life out instead of constantly hounding her for her time. Maybe, instead of hearing from me that I want to hang out, all she really needs to hear right now is just that I love her and am praying for her.\n\nIt still hurts a little, and I still feel a little lonely. But I'm asking God to fill up with Himself the spot that my best friend is leaving empty right now. The spot will always be ready for her whenever she is willing and able to fill it again, but for now I trying to turn to God tofill the space. The loneliness, the emptiness, can be all consuming sometimes, but if I can learn to start relying on God to love and fill me up, then I can stop focusing on how people can love and fill me up and instead start focusing on how I can love and fill up other people.\n___\n``@Koltrast``\nPhilippians 2\nWhat Paul says here is something I’ve noticed by those who seem to really know God; they have a genuine interest in others. In a community where everybody guards their own interests, looks to their own needs, keeps their own backs safe, there will always only be one person looking out for you (yourself). But in a community where everybody has everybody’s back, as much as their own, there will be dozens looking out for you. There will be dozens looking out for each and every person. And that, I believe, is the secret to peace and prosperity\n_____\n\n``@ReaperOfKings``\nalso, 10 benefits to reading THE BIBLE: it helps u past time it helps you learn about god. god will bless u. u can FINALLY understand what preachers are talking about in churches about god. it can EXPAND your mind! it helps with calming down. you can become a preacher you can tell a bed time story to ur kids and have many. you'll learn bout the true god. you will understand why lucifer is bad\n___\n``@rexayas``\nHey really nice remknder from my todays read: Jeremia 29,12 - when we pray god listens and he will hear us. Like not just the voices in our mouths but our longings deep in our hearts. And he will fulfill them in his timing ^^\n___\n``@Jaycee425``\n1 cor 8-9 there is a thin line between being holy and being legalistic. When we love God we love other people, and because we love other people we want to edify them. If there is something that might offend others that I can avoid doing then that should I do. Everyone has different level of faith and I should not expect a new Christian to be as rooted as I am but instead I should built on that faith that one day they might understand the same level i am or higher.\n\nEph 2:8-9 you dont do good works to be saved, you do good works because you ARE saved. We are going to heaven because you believed what Jesus has done in the cross for us.\n___\n\n___\n``@ChiefChips``\nGood morning y'all! Today I read Matthew 5 and it had a TON of lessons in such a short passage! There were three points that stuck out to me - first, we shouldn't be trying to get as close to sin as possible without \"committing\" the sin, rather as far away as we can from it. Jesus talks about how we already commit adultery if we even lustfully think of a woman or a man. In the example Jesus gave, I feel as if the person would make themselves believe they are not doing anything wrong because they aren't physically committing adultery - but in reality they are. Second, what stuck out to me was the section on oaths. Jesus mentions that we shouldn't be swearing or needing to promise anything; our focus should not be oaths, rather that our yes may be yes, and our no may be no. Let's be men and women of our word. Lastly, what stuck out to me was the part on loving our enemy. Jesus makes this clear statement that just because the Gentiles (the world) don't love their enemies, it doesn't mean we should act the same. He makes this explicit comment that we are to be a stark contrast from how the Gentiles, the world, act; the example He uses is to love our enemies. This is a great parallel with with His statement on being the Light of the world. Let us not be like the world (people who aren't Children of God), but examples of Christ's love and may people see Jesus in the way we live and behave. I'm not saying all of this is easy but let us strive with the glory of God and pursue the life Jesus asks us to live! God Bless and thanks for reading!\n___\n``@ChiefChips``\nGood morning y'all! Today I read Matthew 6 and a section that really touched me were verses 31 - 34: \" 31 So do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ 32 For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. 33 But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. 34 Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.\" Sometimes we worry too much and forget that God is there for us and that His plan if perfect. Focus on seeking our Heavenly Father and He will help you out! I know this is difficult but let us stop worrying about what we want, rather focus on God and trust in Him, He has everything in control! :)\n___\n``@ChiefChips``\nGood morning/afternoon/evening, today I read Matthew 7 and the different sections in it really mix well with one another! Jesus talks about hearing the words He speaks and putting them into practice - this is associated with having a great foundation. Once we have this foundation on Christ and in the Word, it goes well with His message on being good trees who bear good fruit. Remember though, we shouldn't first focus on what \"fruits\" we can bear without having this foundation because then our actions aren't as worthy as we think, that's why Jesus states in Matthew 7:21 - 23, \" “21 Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. 22 Many will say to me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles?’ 23 Then I will tell them plainly, ‘I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!\" Let us always examine ourselves and see for what reason we do certain actions and not deceive ourselves with the lies the Devil puts in our minds. Let's do everything to glorify our Father in Heaven and with genuine love! If you want to see more on this Jesus talks about it greatly in Matthew 6:1-7; 16-18. Thanks for reading and God Bless!\n___\n``@ChiefChips``\nGood morning y'all, today I read Matthew 10. In one of its sections it talks about spreading the word of God and going from place to place so that different people can hear about it. What spoke to me was the fact that we are called to spread it. We shouldn't be focused too much on trying to get everyone to believe us and to change, \"Matthew 10:14, \"If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, leave that home or town and shake the dust off your feet.\" Our calling is to spread the word of God and if some people don't want to hear it, that's okay, don't be discouraged! Thanks for reading and God Bless!\n___\n``@dianajazmin123``\nGood morning ! I wanted to share something I read on my 7 days anxiety detox plan that I found in the Bible study on YouVersion if interested. What I read was that some of us see their flaws as something negative and we hate ourselves for it but we shouldn’t because through that God can show his power and we are able to help others that are hurt or broken or like me have fears and insecurities. As the author simply states “His power is made perfect in your weakness” and the verse that I read that goes along with this is John 9:2-3. Hope this helps somebody.\n___\n``ChiefChips``\nGood morning, today I read Matthew 15! The first section was mainly about Jesus rebuking the Pharisees because they were condemning Jesus' disciples for not washing their hands before they ate bread - which was part of their human tradition. Jesus talked about what condemns a person shouldn't be what enters our mouth, rather what comes out of our mouth. The reason is because due to us having a sinful body/heart, it leads to us having sinful thoughts which can produce harmful words or malicious actions. Therefore, we are to guard our heart and truly be cautious of what we say and what we do. We are children of God and we ought to behave like it! Thanks for reading and God Bless!\n___\n``@dianajazmin123``\nGood morning y’all Today I learned that each one of us tend to have tend to get stir crazy when we feel stuck in one place like when we experience the stay home order. It’s like a domino effect where we feel stuck which leads to feeling uneasy and anxiety to feeling like the walls are closing in on us and their is no hope. But it’s important to remember that we need to lay our worries and anything that gives us anxiety to our Heavenly Father so we can get true peace also God ask that we need to be clear headed and alert for the real enemy as he’s always like a Lion waiting patiently to devour it ! Also if we were to struggle and suffer and yet we stay close to our Father he will restore us. Read 1 Peter 5:6-11 hope this helps someone.\n___\n\n",

They mated and kindled, producing a litter of six kittens. Unfortunately, soon after the kindling, Apalos was eaten by a snake. Not only, but the kits' softer Moon Rabbit skulls cracked under their Almiraj horns, unable to bear the weight. In grief, Iliako named all six of her kits things that could be a rabbit's undoing: Starvation, Solitude, Python, Thirst, Flood, Disease.\n\nSomehow, two of the kits, Solitude and Thirst, survived. Thirst didn't have a horn at all, and seemed to have gotten more of her sire's genes, being a pure white with soft fur and an extra plump skin at her side. Solitude, meanwhile, was a different story. At first Iliako thought he had inherited both her tough skull and horn (along with an Almiraj's dark navy blue, though she herself was a bright yellow), though this revealed not to be the case.\n\nSolitude had a hollow horn of keratin with little bony core, attached mostly to the skin of his head instead of his skull. It was a scur, which Iliako had no idea how to deal with. The matter took care of itself in a couple days when Solitude rolled over and the horn snapped halfway, miraculously not breaking skin. After that, he grounded the constantly growing horn against trees and rocks, keeping it trimmed.\n\nWhen they reached four weeks of age (a full week late because Iliako fussed over them), Solitude and Thirst left their nest and set off from their mother's side.\n\n**Classes**: History (where you learn about the history of mythological rabbits), Geography (where you learn about the places around the world with mythological rabbits), Training Your Mythology Rabbit (where you learn to train and take care of your mythological rabbit), Mythology (where you learn about the mythological rabbits themselves) Mythological Rabbit Bonding (where you learn how to bond with your mythological rabbit)\n\n**Schedule**: History: Monday through Friday at 1:00 P.M.-2:00 P.M., Geography: Tuesday and Thursday at 10:00 A.M.-11:00 A.M., Training Your Mythological Rabbit: Monday through Friday at 2:30 P.M.-3:30 P.M., Mythology: Monday and Wednesday at 9:00 A.M.-10:00 A.M., Mythological Rabbit Bonding: Monday through Friday at 3:45 P.M.-4:45 P.M.\n\n**Uniforms**: Male: Sailor shirt with any tie color, pants with same color as tie (if you don’t want pants, you may request something different) Female: Sailor shirt with any tie color, miniskirt with same color as tie (if you don’t want a skirt, you may request something different) Non-binary: Sailor shirt with any tie color, either skirt or pants with same color as tie (you pick) Genderfluid or Genderflux (or anything under the genderfluid or genderflux umbrella): You get multiple uniform bottoms (however many you need) *Note: for the people with miniskirts, you are also given leggings with same color as tie + skirt that you wear in cold weather, and for the people with pants, you have shorts in warm weather and long pants in cold weather* \n\n**Dormitories**: You randomly get assigned several roommates in your same year that will be your roommates for all ten years of education. \n\n**Meals**: Breakfast: 8:00 A.M.-9:00 A.M., Lunch: 11:00 A.M.-12:00 A.M., Dinner: 5:00 P.M.-6:00 P.M.\n\n**Warren Interior**: Dining room, Mythology classroom, bathrooms, History classroom, Geography classroom, Dormitories, bathrooms, Dormitories, bathrooms, Dormitories, bathrooms\n\n**Outdoors**: Training Your Mythological Rabbit & Mythological Rabbit Bonding classroom (they share the classroom), garden (with rabbit-safe plants in it), lake\n\n**Warren Exterior**: Large and ancient underground warren (huge enough for humans to comfortably live in!)\n\n**Term**: Starts August 1st, ends June 1st\n\n**Breaks**: Holiday Break (December 15-January 2), Easter Break (April 4-April 10), Summer Break (June 1st-August 1st)\n\n**Weekends**: On weekends, you are not required to wear your uniform on weekends, on you do not have classes. \n\n**Years**: 10=1st \n                   11=2nd\n                   12=3rd\n                   13=4th\n                   14=5th",

I'll most likely kill you in the morning.\" ~The Dread Pirate Roberts to his cabinboy\n\nShip to ship battles:  4 \n\nVictories: 2\n\nDefeats: 2\n\n**Past battle history:**  The Ship of the Dread Pirate Roberts won it's battle with ethereal flamingos. Well, not quite battle... Then the  Revenge navigated a whirlpool on it's journey to Penzance where the crew tracked down the ol' quartermaster in an abandoned tin mine. After provisioning the ship the captain was determining their next course. [As in destination NOT the next meal] when the ship had to take evasive action to avoid an unpleasant visit from Krampus.  \n~~not so~~ -**Recent battle news:** Word reached the Dread Pirate ~~Roberts~~ Linsanity of a Mysterious Train [possibly rich in plunder] travelling around Habitica. The Revenge anchored in Inkomplete Bay and devised a **\"cunning plan\"**.\nThe chase were on and the Revenge tracked down the Train and launched 'er attack in the chat of [The Mystery Train](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/47fc51a5-0f84-4805-9f2f-e398d628f78e) \n\"It were a close thing but them folks on the train managed ter do more new things than us an'won by a narrer margin. We'd ave ter fly their flag fer at least a week ceptin' they don't akchally 'ave one\" *the captain laughed*.  \n\"I reckons it be as good as a win as we made off wi'various items o'plunder an' gained a few new recruits!\"  \n**Recent exploits**  The cap'n's efforts ter get the Ship resupplied were  thwarted by a mangled map's missin' markin's then some suspicious savages set the ship a'smoulderin'. Heroic efforts o' th' crew saved the day-Ta Da! \n \n**More Recent events** After the Ship were becalmed fer a while by th' effects o' the doldrums [on the crew!] the cap'n were due some furlough on board another ship when she were reportedly snatched up by a dragon. Fer some reason bosun were transformed inter a four-legged kreecher ta aid First mate QuartzFox an' Lightmotif in the rescue.\n\nThen th' Ship were stuck in the Doldrums agin, an' this time 'twere th' Cook that went missin'. She were found thanks ta the valiant efforts o' @Kitbeard who scoured many a vessel on the seas o' Habitica.  \nSum o'th' crew was misbehavin' with th' unfamiliar task o' dealin' wi' 'vegebabbles'. Th' cap'n was relieved that Cook restrained from any retaliatory violence on 'er return.\n\n**MOST RECENT events**  ARRRR!!!!! There were a mutiny an' th' First Mate QuartzFox were promoted ta captain!  \n'T'were an amicable mutiny. No'un were **made** ta walk th' plank; tho Linsanity went fer a voluntry dip in the briny an' be lookin' forard ta bein' th' Ship's sawbones agin.\n\n**CHALLENGES**\n\n**Talk like a Pirate Challenge** [self-explanatory I hope] Sep 2021 was won by @C_ ; who is not a spy or British.   \n[ I just realised when I added this update that the winner's moniker is pronounced **At Sea** Bahaha!]\n\n**Past Challenges** The Pirate Rap ~~Trap~~ Challenge were won by @Quartzfox. Congrats! Takiwatanga were the runner-up an' claimed a share o' th'booty too.   \nMEmry won the Save our Cap'n Challenge.  \nVirtual Swabbies encouraged some Habiticans to venture into online exploration whilst in lockdown by covid19.\n\n~~not so~~ -**Recent Challenge**    \n [Poshuns!](https://habitica.com/challenges/7cd73353-bebc-4147-ac8a-d5ff86c44bcc) had the current courageous crew tentatively testing the bosun's bounty o' potentially poisonous poshuns in a rousin' round o' roulette!  \nwhich ye kin read about [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N8reMYBM7Am5k9m_IFwJNYJoXq6oJXXl5XBCDZypRjQ/edit)  \nThe Cook and the Doldrums challenge.\n\n**PREPARATIONS were UNDERWAY TO CHALLENGE the GAMEFIED READING ~~SHIP~~ Guild TO A BATTLE**   \nbut were postponed due to 'reasons' (I reckons they're just lilly-livered) so another challenge were created ta [Find a Captain/guildleader interested in a Ship ta Ship Battle/inter-guild challenge](https://habitica.com/challenges/41e688e7-9bca-4bac-af33-9e9e368e830b) **with a 3 gem prize**\n\n## **The cap'n still 'as some booty tucked away fer worthwhile ventures;** so iffen any o' ye has any ideas just send a message [by PM, **not** in a bottle]\n\nAn [English-to-Pirate Translator](http://pirate.monkeyness.com/online_pirate_translator) is available to all. \n",

      "description":"![Artistic Studies header](https://i.imgur.com/yc9lbgq.png) \n\n## **Guild News:** *NEW CHALLENGE!!*  \nit is public so that hopefully we can grow our guild numbers and activity! im so excited!! ☆\n\n## [☆ Artistic Studies - Animals: Small Mammals -- 4 Week Challenge -- Mar '23 ☆](https://habitica.com/challenges/06bd497e-4536-4500-a6f8-31f582fc791b)\n---\n\n## About:\nA place for people who want to build up their visual library and establish art study habits by regularly posting their work. Let's encourage each other to grow as artists! ☆ ♡\n\n---\n\n\n## F.A.Q. \n\n* **How do I post images?** – Posting your work is the heart of this guild – this question has its own section further down below. \n* **Is my art a study?** – Regularly posting focused studies  serves the purpose of improving in a certain area. As a rule of thumb: if you could throw your images away and not be upset, they are probably studies. If you could sell them or use them as a gift, then they're probably something else. \n* **Is feedback allowed?** – Constructive criticism may be given if the poster included `#OpenforCC` in their post. Likewise, you can append the hashtag to your own posts if you are open to constructive feedback. \n\n---\n\n## How to link and display images: \n\nFirst, you need to upload your image(s) to a hosting site. It must be publicly accessible without a login (i.e. no Instagram. [Imgur](https://imgur.com/) is a popular free option (no account required, but recommended for editing). Others are imagebb, Dropbox, Trello etc. Once you've uploaded it there and checked that its visibility is set to \"public\", copy the link to the image or album and create a markdown link in chat like this: \n\n`[title of the image](link to the image)`\n\nAdditionally, you can put an exclamation point in front of an image link to have it be displayed in chat directly:\n\n`![title of the image](link to the image)`\n\nThere is no space in the middle (between `]` and `(`). \n\n---\n\n**Posting guidelines**:\n\n* Every link should be put at the beginning of your post and formatted with markdown as described above for maximum accessibility. \n* If you display images in chat, always include the markdown links to them, as well (since some Habitica version can neither display URLs nor images in the chat) \n* Please merge multiple comments into one big comment – guild chats can only hold 200 messages. Help preserve old posts! \n\n---\n\n## Links & Resources: \n\n* [Digital Painting Guild](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/639bbc77-25f1-4274-a81a-cb19cd769c0f) if you work digitally // [Learn to Draw guild](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/95b7ce2c-0d50-4ef7-9d15-87c7d2857024) for prompts and fellow art learners. \n* [Drawabox.com](https://href.li/?https://drawabox.com/) – free lessons with homework on how to draw perspective – for absolute beginners \n* [Lovelifedrawing website](https://href.li/?https://www.lovelifedrawing.com/) or [YT channel](https://href.li/?https://www.youtube.com/@lovelifedrawing) – free lessons on figure drawing.

      "description":"**Treatments That Work**\n\n\nAttention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in adulthood is a prevalent and impairing disorder. While medications have been effective in treating adult ADHD, the majority of individuals treated with medications still have symptoms that require additional skills and symptom management strategies.\n\nThis Second Edition of Mastering Your Adult ADHD is thoroughly updated to present the most current, empirically supported treatment strategies in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for coping with symptoms of adult ADHD. The Therapist Guide provides clinicians with effective means of teaching adult\nclients skills that have been scientifically tested and shown to help them cope with ADHD. The program has been updated to include the optional use of technology and smart phones to improve organization and planning. Core modules cover the development of systems for keeping track of appointments and\ntasks, reducing distractibility, and improving adaptive thinking skills, and there's an optional module on reducing procrastination. Information is also provided regarding holding an informational meeting with a spouse, partner, or family member. The step-by-step, session-by-session descriptions\nare a practical resource for therapists who deliver the treatment. The companion Client Workbook contains all of the necessary information for participating in the practical CBT intervention. It includes worksheets, forms, and a link to an assessment measure that can be used to gauge progress during\ntreatment.",

The series includes two collections of short stories (*The Last Wish* and *Sword of Destiny*) and six novels. \n\n[Barnes & Noble](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/blog/sci-fi-fantasy/where-to-start-reading-the-books-that-inspired-netflixs-the-witcher/) wrote an article about the books and the show, including links to buy the books directly from them. You can also choose to buy them from Amazon for [Kindle](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FK8KY54?searchxofy=true&binding=kindle_edition&ref_=dbs_s_aps_series_rwt_tkin&qid=1633629572&sr=8-3) or [Print](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=the+witcher+andrzej+sapkowski&crid=3T0W00JM2IUJF&sprefix=the+witcher+and%2Caps%2C242&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_1_15). \n\nIf you're not sure what order to read them in, you can check out this article on [PC Gamer](https://www.pcgamer.com/the-witcher-books/), which also briefly discusses the games and the Netflix series. But here's the best order according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witcher).\n1. \"A Grain of Truth,\" \"The Lesser Evil,\" \"The Edge of the World,\" and \"The Last Wish\" (*The Last Wish*)\n2. \"A Question of Price\" (*Sword of Destiny*)\n3. *Season of Storms*\n4. \"The Witcher\" and \"The Voice of Reason\" (*The Last Wish*)\n5. \"The Bounds of Reason,\" \"A Shard of Ice,\" \"Eternal Flame,\" \"A Little Sacrifice,\" \"Sword of Destiny,\" and \"Something More\" (*Sword of Destiny*)\n6. *Blood of Elves*\n7. *Time of Contempt*\n8. *Baptism of Fire*\n9. *The Tower of the Swallow*\n10. *The Lady of the Lake*\n11. Epilogue to the *Season of Storms*\n___\n### Video Games\nThe series also includes [video games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witcher_(video_game_series)), the third one selling over 50 million copies. I've included the main games below.\n* The first main game, *The Witcher,* was released in 2007 for Microsoft Windows and OS X.\n* The second main game, *The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings* was released in 2011 for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, OS X, and Linux.\n* The third main game, *The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt* was released in 2015 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. A Nintendo Switch version was released in 2019. Additionally, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions were released in 2021. The next-gen update was released on December 7, 2022. The next-gen update includes added content from the Netflix series.\n___\n### Netflix Shows/Movies\nNetflix released [a series](https://www.netflix.com/title/80189685) based on the books in 2019, created by Lauren Schmidt Hissrich and starring Henry Cavill, Anya Chalotra, and Freya Allen.\n* Season 1 was released in its entirety on December 20, 2019. It consists of 8 episodes.\n* Season 2 was released in its entirety on December 17, 2021. It also consists of 8 episodes.\n* Season 3 was announced in September 2021, scheduled for release in Summer of 2023.\n\nIn addition to the series, Netflix also released an animated spin-off from the series, entitled [The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf](https://www.netflix.com/title/81037868), which centers around Geralt's mentor and fellow witcher Vesemir. Also produced by Hissrich, it stars Theo James as Vesemir.\n\nThere is another spin-off, a Netflix series titled [The Witcher: Blood Origin](https://www.netflix.com/title/81279312). Filming started in August 2021 and it was released on December 25, 2022. It consists of 4 episodes.\n\nNow if you're anything like me, you have trouble following the non-linear timeline. It definitely makes the show more engaging to watch, but it's hard to discern who was born first or what events happened when. Luckily for us, Netflix created an [interactive map and timeline](https://www.witchernetflix.com/en-gb) that helps clarify a ***lot*** of the confusion of the series. It also includes events from the Nightmare of the Wolf (and maybe in the future, Blood Origins as well) so I ***highly*** recommend you check it out.\n___\n### Other\nThe books also inspired comic books, a Polish movie, and a Polish series. You can read about them on the [Witcher Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witcher).",

      "description":"**My description:**  \nAbout half the population of the world speaks an Indo-European language. Uropi is based on the common ancestor of these languages (Proto-Indo-European or P.I.E.) so as to be familiar to more people.\n\nThe most common descendants were chosen, pronunciation is straightforward (one letter = one sound), stress is regular with accent marks showing when stress falls somewhere unexpected. The gender of nouns is simple: a noun is \"male\" if it is actually male (father, brother, a male dog, etc.), \"female\" if it is actually female (mother, sister, a female dog, etc.), and \"neuter\" if it has no real gender (a car, a book, a frying pan, etc.). Verbs are regular & conjugate only for tense, not person.\n\nUropi is wonderful. It has a strange familiarity and a beautiful, unique sound that doesn't seem to favor any single branch of the Indo-European language family (it doesn't sound \"Italic\" or \"Germanic\" or \"Slavic\" or \"Indic\" to me). Actually, it kinda sounds like High Valyrian, Simlish (the Sims' language), or—and I'm dating myself here—the Divine Language from Fifth Element.\n\n---\n\n**Official Websites:**  \n[Uropi](http://uropi.free.fr/index1.html)  \n[Uropi Portal](https://sites.google.com/site/uropivarkia/)  \n[Uropi Vordar id Gramatik](https://sites.google.com/site/uropivordar/)  \n\n**Info / Resources:**  \n[Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/uropi/?ref=share)  \n[Fandom](https://uropi.fandom.com/wiki/Introduction_to_Uropi)  \n[Langoland](http://lang.uropi.free.fr/index_uk.php)  \n[Omniglot](https://omniglot.com/language/phrases/uropi.htm)  \n[Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uropi)\n\n**Blogs:**  \n[Uropi](http://uropi.canalblog.com/) ```Uropi, Français, & English```  \n[Uropi, the Link...](http://uropi.blogspot.com/)\n\n**Videos:**  \nYouTube channel: [Kanàl Uropi](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6C3Ug8Sx84MWbv49oGqHeXW8HfQiA0Ar)\n\n**Memrise Courses:**  \n_The language in parentheses is the reference language._  \n[Kovoko Uropi](http://www.memrise.com/course/5902731/) (Deutsch) `2 phrase lists`  \n[Uropi Fraze](http://www.memrise.com/course/5913795/) (Swedish) ```½ phrase list```  \n[Vokem Uropi (Engli)](http://www.memrise.com/course/5902227/) (English) `5 lessons`  \n[Vokem Uropi (Franci)](http://www.memrise.com/course/5902498/) (Français) `2 lessons`  \n_These are works in progress!

From Esperanto, with over 70% of its vocabulary of latin origin, to Neo which puts up this percentage to over 75 % and to Interlingua which reaches 100%, the 'internationality' issue  never seems to have been raised; the trend has always been towards more 'naturalism'....\n\nIt would be ridiculous to make an artificial mixture of Chinese, Swahili, English and Urdu . . . Tagalog and Aymara. It would be just as vain to use the recent research on “the mother tongue” - which is, at any rate, questioned by other linguists....\n\nIn view of this, it seemed to me that the only way, the only sensible way was to choose  Indo-European roots as a starting point. Indeed, Indo-European languages (I.E.L) are spoken on the five continents (several billions of speakers)....\n\nThis being said, those Indo-European roots could only serve as a starting point, because, in their present shape which has been reconstructed by linguists, they are often too complex and hardly recognizable for today’s speakers. Thus, we had to follow their history to the present day,  and see whether those roots gave birth to contemporary words or not, select those which are common to the largest number of living languages, eliminate those which sank into oblivion....\n\nOn the GRAMMATICAL as well as LEXICAL LEVELS, Uropi is a very democratic language: the majority wins.\n\nFor example: what term could be chosen for apple ?\n\n1) The Indo-European root abol*/abel* = apple, can be found in _22 ancient and modern languages_: Gaulish avallo, old Irish ubull, Gaelic úll, Welsh afal, Breton aval, Gothic apel, old Icelandic eple, Icelandic epli-, Old High German apful > Ger. Apfel, Dutch. appel, Eng. apple, Danish æble, Norwegian eple, Swedish äple, Lithuanian obuolys, Latvian âbols, old Slavonic ablüko > Russian iabloko, Czech: jablko, Polish: jabl-ko, Serbo-Croatian jabuka, **hence Uropi apel.**\n\n2) Greek mhlon 'mêlon', Latin malum, modern Greek mhlo 'mîlo', Italian mela, Rumanian mär, Albanian móllë = _6 languages_\n\n3) Spanish manzana, Portuguese maçã = _2 languages_\n\n4) French pomme = _1 language_ > **Esperanto pomo**\n\nFor drink ?\n\n1) I-E pibô* > skr. pibati (he drinks), hin. pînâ, Tzigane pi (to drink), old Arm. ëmpem (I drink), Arm. embéli (a drink), Alb. pi (to drink),  Gr. pinw (pinô), Lat. bibo > It bevo, Sp. bebo, Rum. beau, old Irish. ibim (I drink), Port. beber, Catalan beure, Bret. evañ (to drink), Rus. pit’, Pol. pic’, Ser.Cro. piti, Cz. píti (= to drink; + in all Slavic languages pivo/wo = beer), that is _19 languages:_ **hence Uropi  pivo = to drink.**\n\n2)  Ger. trinken, Du. drinken, Eng. drink, Da. Nor. drikke, Swe. dricka = _6 languages_ > **Esperanto trinki**\n\nThe GENITIVE: -i(s), -u(s) in Uropi,\nfor example: man, mani, manis = man, man’s, men’s; mata, matu, matus = mother, mother’s, mothers’, exists in all Germanic languages (Eng., Ger., Swe., Da. Nor.), except in Dutch, in all Slavic (Rus., Pol., Cz., Serbo-Croatian, etc…) and Baltic languages (Lithuanian & Latvian), in Armenian, Albanian, Greek and Rumanian, that is at least in _15 languages_ (not to mention Ukrainian, Bielorussian and Bulgarian).\n\nOn the other hand, the accusative, which has been kept in Esperanto, only remains in _8 languages_ (Slavic and Baltic, in Greek and in German) and its forms have been considerably reduced in the latter two languages.\"\n\n---\n\n**Vowels**  \na = Fr. patte, Ge. Stadt, It. pace, Sp. casa  \nEx: kat (catt) = cat\n\ne = e in It./Sp. pepe, or e in En. bed  \nEx: keb (keb) = head, kebe (like \"pepe\") =heads\n\ni = It./Sp. vino, Fr. ville  \nEx: nil (nil) = thread\n\no = o in En. not, or o in It. solo, voglio  \nEx: pot (pot) = pot\n\nu = oo longer than in En. book, shorter than in En. moon  \nEx: sud (sood) = south\n\n**Consonants**  \nb, d, f, k, l, m, n, p, t, v, and z  are pronounced as in French, German, Spanish, Italian, and English  \n\nc = sh in En. shut, bush  \nEx: ca (shah), vaco (vasho), mico (misho), cus (shooss), noc (nosh)\n\ng = g in En. give, girl (never as in giraffe)  \nEx: gam (gam), gen (gen), gis (giss), leg (leg)\n\nh = h in En. house, Ge. Haus  \nEx: has (hass), he (heh), hol (hol)\n\nj = y in En. yoghurt, boy  \nEx: ja (yah), jo (yo), je (yay), ji (yee)\n\nʒ (sometimes '3') = Fr. jour, déjà-vu, \"s\" in En. measure, pleasure, treasure, Asia, zh in Zhivago  \nEx. ʒun (zhoon), paʒ (pazh), ʒa (zha)\n\nr = rolled as in Italian, Spanish, Russian, Scottish  \nEx: ren (rren), Rus (rrooss)\n\ns = always ss as in En. bus, case (never z as in cheese)  \nEx: su (Sue), hase (hassé)\n\nw = w as in En. in what, water, cow  \nEx: we (way), wim (whim), wan (wan)\n\n---\n\n**Conjugation**  \nUropi verbs never conjugate for person, but only for tense (like Danish).\n\n**Simple Tenses**  \nPresent tense is formed simply by removing the **-o** (infinitive ending) for most verbs. Occasionally, one must add **-e** for pronunciation: **so** (to be) – **-o** = **s** which doesn't really create a pronouncable word—but **s** + **-e** = **se** (am, are, is) is better for pronunciation.\n\nPast tense is formed by removing the **-o** (infinitive ending) and adding **-ì** (the past tense ending). Please note that the accent means the stress in the word may move. For **so** (to be), it doesn't matter much, because it remains a one-syllable word in all tenses. However, for **veno** (to come), the stress remains on the central **e** for the present tense—**vene**—but moves to the **-ì** ending in the past tense—**venì**.\n\nThe conditional tense is formed by removing the **-o** (infinitive ending) and adding **-ev**. Because there is no accent mark, the stress remains on central syllable: **ven** + **-ev** = **venev** (would come).\n\n---\n\nTALE BE GORI POSMIDIÀ (ALL IN THE GOLDEN AFTERNOON)  \n(Carroll, Lewis. _Alice in Wonderland_. Translated into Uropi by Joël Landais, creator of Uropi.)\n\n***Tale be gori posmidià / Lanim nu se slizan / Par anvikli miki rame / Ni reme se rucan / Id protensi miki mande / Prob duto ni valgad***  \nAll in the golden afternoon / Full leisurely we glide; / For both our oars, with little skill, / By little arms are plied, / While little hands make vain pretence / Our wanderings to guide.\n\n***Oh, krual Tri, in u sul hor, / Ude sa soinic verem, / Prag’ u sag a u tio flabi / Fles po flo de minies ped! / Ka moz u pavri voc valto, / Gon tri linge unizen?***  \nAh, cruel Three! In such an hour, / Beneath such dreamy weather, / To beg a tale of breath too weak / To stir the tiniest feather! / Yet what can one poor voice avail / Against three tongues together?  \n\n***De imperic Prima bas prim / Ci usdèz \"Po inìzo...\" / Sekunda vue, ba maj sovim / \"Las je ste ek disvalgad!\" / Id Tertia de sag intrakòt / Solem unvos be minùt.***  \nImperious Prima flashes forth / Her edict \"to begin it\"— / In gentler tones Secunda hopes / \"There will be nonsense in it!\"— / While Tertia interrupts the tale / Not more than once a minute.\n\n***Beprù vikten pa de silad / Lu slog in imaʒinad / De soinikìd muvan in land / Mirvizis novi’d strani, / Ki best’, ovle framim blatan / Nerim kredan ja veri.***  \nAnon, to sudden silence won, / In fancy they pursue / The dream-child moving through a land / Of wonders wild and new, / In friendly chat with bird or beast— / And half believe it true.\n\n***Talvos, wan de sag sorizì / De kwel imaʒinadi, / Id wan de ustanen probì / Pospero ja maj posen, / \"De slog nes vos...\" \"Num se nes vos!\" / De glaj voce usklàj.***  \nAnd ever, as the story drained / The wells of fancy dry, / And faintly strove that weary one / To put the subject by, / \"The rest next time—\" \"It is next time!\" / The happy voices cry.\n\n***Sim de sag Mirvizilandi / Genì: lanim, un pos un / Strani usvenade suzì. / Num de sag se fenden / A dom se navan de skipad / Glaj ude solifàl.***  \nThus grew the tale of Wonderland: / Thus slowly, one by one, / Its quaint events were hammered out— / And now the tale is done, / And home we steer, a merry crew, / Beneath the setting sun.\n\n***Alisa! Nem di kidisag, / Id ki ti sovi mand, / Set ja wo se pleten soine / In mistiki bind rumenis, / Wim wisten flore pelgrini / Pliken in u dali land.***  \nAlice! A childish story take, / And with a gentle hand, / Lay it where Childhood's dreams are twined / In Memory's mystic band, / Like pilgrim's withered wreath of flowers / Plucked in far-off land.",

      "description":"Greetings, dear citizens! This newly created guild, promoted by @Ektael and @Dea_Matrona, has the intention of gathering all of us who actually know how to dress properly in Habitica. Therefore, if you wanna share your pixel-art-outfits with others, join us in this aesthetic experience. \n\nOur very first interactional activities may be exposing outfits and explaining concepts behind our fashion choices. Also, I might invite people found in other places from Habitica that presented nice outfits. So, if you were suddenly invited, this is what happened.\n\nThis doesn't mean, however, that invitations cannot be made by others - several members have prospected interested people already, so everyone is allowed to encounter someone and invite them in.\n\n[Challenges schedule for challengers.](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=N3BiZTMwc3U2bmcwa3YxdGxrdDdraWdtZmtAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ)\n\n[Outfits' archive from previous challenges.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L_aI71l4QFbdiRMJnX0xhl25-pptrr4fQQuUt-9sKu0/edit#gid=171258499)\n\n**HOW TO POST PICTURES IN CHAT?**\n\n*Step 1*\n\nTake a screenshot of your avatar and crop it down. This can be done on either a computer or a mobile device.\n\n*Step 2*\n\nUpload that screenshot to an image hosting site online. `postimages.org` is used by most members!\n\n*Step 3*\n\nFor posting an image in the chat, you'll need to use markdown formatting. For this, you should use the following `![text alt](URLofImage \"optional mouse title\")`. Simply insert a link obtained from the image hosting site that ends with either .jpeg or .png in the \"URLofImage\" section and it's done!\n\nI hope that helps!",

      "description":"Welcome to the Immersion Language Learning Guild!\n\nOur focus is to provide support, encouragement, and to share tips to help others who are using immersion on their language learning journey. This guild is a place for anyone who is using immersion to learn their target language (not just for people who strictly use immersion techniques only). The goal of this guild it to support learners in being consistent with their learning as opposed to hitting specific time or number based metrics and our challenges will be reflective of this goal. \n\nFor those who are new to immersion learning, it is a way of learning a language where you immerse (spend a lot of time) using native materials in your target language (the language you wish to learn) this not only improves your ability to acquire the language, but also makes it more fun as you are learning with material you enjoy! (Movies, books, manga, video games etc!)\n\nFor more information on immersion learning check out [Refold](https://refold.la/roadmap)\nRefold is a great place to get some information on immersion based learning, but do not get overwhelmed. You do not need to follow its methods to the T, your language learning journey is all about you and what works for you. \n\nFor a fellow language learner who focuses on sustainable immersion and host bi-monthly at home language immersion retreats check out [leafling learns](https://www.instagram.com/leaf.ling_learns/?hl=en) I highly recommend trying to participate in one of her minimmersion events for all immersion language learners!\n\nFor new guild members please introduce yourself in the chat and say what language/ languages you are currently learning! Also, if you have any good resources on where to find immersion content in your target language please share! I hope to compile a list in the future as a resource for other learners.",

Anyone is welcome here in The Depresso Gang. All you need is to want to work towards improving your day to day executive functioning.\n\n### Are there rules?\n\nYes! While you're here, keep this in mind:\n\n1. Be respectful.\n2. No slurs.\n3. Rules are subject to change as the needs of the community become clear.\n\n#### Okay... and who are you?\n\nHi, I'm Landon! I've been part of the depresso gang all my life. I got some clinical depression, generalized anxiety, and am transgender to boot, so my life has a lot of ups and downs. I've decided to host monthly challenges based on something I want to focus on, and figure this guild is a good thing to go along with it because I'd like to get to know the people completing the challenges with me.\n\n### Challenge Winners\n\n**June 2021** - Do The (Hygiene) Hustle! - Kuschelelfe",

This guild is best viewed via website for now.\n\n---\n*Success by the yard is hard; success by the inch is a cinch.* \n\n*How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time.*\n\n![calendar-banner](https://i.imgur.com/irqPOOs.png)\n## **Welcome to Calendar To Dos**\n\nIs your To Do column a mountain of urgent items? I know how it feels. My To Do column used to be like this:\n\n![old-todos](https://i.imgur.com/CPDqgeX.png)\n\nSadly I couldn't muster the will to tackle those long red tasks. Their size defeated me before I even started. Then one day someone wise gave me a piece of advice: \n\n***\"Work from a calendar – not a To Do list.\"***\n\nA day ends every 24 hours but a To Do list doesn't. Without a time deadline looming large, my lizard brain wouldn't budge. So I started over and changed my To Do column into this:    \n \n![new-todos](https://i.imgur.com/rZN1Dei.png)\n\nAbove I've shown just the first 3 days, but you get the idea. After setup I hid everything except today:    \n \n![new-todos-collapsed](https://i.imgur.com/P5lrGvy.png)\n\nThat looked MUCH simpler! No more opening 12 checklists on 12 To Dos, juggling multiple due dates or stressing over what was most urgent. My new routine: complete today's one and only To Do by midnight... hey, I can do that 😀\n\nAnd that's just what I did. Once I broke my To Do column into days instead of tasks and did one To Do a day, things were soon back on track and I've never had big problems since. \n\nHow do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. If your To Do column is beating you up, try this method and share if it helped or not – all feedback is welcome. If you're new here, say hi in the chat!\n\n---\n## **Sponsor List**\n\n**❤️ Thank you to the people below for donating gems.** \n\n**💎 10** @alys, @MaybeSteveRogers \n\n**💎 3** @NCSUshley \n\n**💎 1** @TheUnmessJess\n\nAll gems will be used as challenge prizes.

For example if I missed Monday's tasks and my column is MON to FRI, I just rename MON (today's missed To Do) as SAT then drag/drop it at the end.\n\n**How to fix a missed day (sequential)**\n\nFor task items that must be done sequentially, copy/paste the To Do titles to shuffle everything back a day. MON (today's missed To Do) would be renamed TUE (tomorrow). TUE becomes WED, WED becomes THU and so on. That way the task item order isn't changed.\n\n**How to avoid missing a day**\n\nThe surest way I miss days is by overloading them. The idea is to not demotivate myself with huge checklists. I have 3–4 items per day, no more. New tasks are scheduled into the following week if the current week is full.\n\nFewer = easier = 0 missed days. I like my To Dos moving steadily instead of hitting problems attempting too much.\n\n**Incorporating rewards into this method**\n\nSetting targets and rewards is easy. 0 missed days in April earns a reward, for example.\n\n**Bulk creating To Dos**\n\nOn my computer I keep a plain text file with my To Do titles separated by line breaks (Shift + Enter).\n\n`**TUE 01 MAR**`\n\n`**WED 02 MAR**`\n\n`**THU 03 MAR**` (etc)\n\nI copy/paste 2–4 weeks of titles into the Add a To Do entry field and Habitica creates all the To Dos in one go.\n\n**Is it inconvenient to run long term**\n\nThere was a big learning curve in the first month – I was very slow and spreading tasks over multiple To Dos felt weird! Once I settled in and started streamlining, things became very fast and efficient. \n\nNow it's a breeze, zero effort to maintain. I don't remember the last time I missed a day and had to drag/drop a To Do. \n\n**Streamlining To Dos**\n\nIf an entire week is very quiet I'll make a single To Do for the week. Alternatively I could make a smaller To Do spanning 3 or 4 consecutive days.\n\n![streamlined](https://i.imgur.com/7Mdeq4e.png)\n\nShown above I've streamlined 10 days into 2 To Dos. Merging quieter periods into a multi-day To Do saves me time and screen space. \n\n**Planning further ahead**\n\nFor future tasks that don't yet have a date – or you haven't made To Dos that far ahead – it's easy to save a reminder in the notes field of an existing To Do. \n\nBelow are some April reminders saved in March's final To Do, ready for when April's To Dos are created. \n\n![reminder](https://i.imgur.com/l7YNA8M.png)\n\n---\n![3rd-party-tools](https://i.imgur.com/MExLAyh.png)\n## **Use a calendar extension**\n\nI prefer working directly in the To Do column, but traditional calendar displays are available. They open in a new browser window and require your User ID and API token.\n\n[HabitCalendar](https://habitcalendar.netlify.app) monthly calendar format (view only)\n\n[HabtitRPG Calendar](https://habitrpg-calendar.herokuapp.com/static/index.html) yearly calendar format (view only)\n\n[Strategetica](https://strategitica.github.io/strategitica/) yearly calendar format (view and edit)",

Remember to be specific and to set deadlines. Try to complete all the tasks related to a step in the journey before moving on to the next step BUT you can work and plan ahead.  \n\nFor a quick overview of the Hero's Journey theory, [watch this video](https://vimeo.com/140767141). Whilst completing that big project might seem like the ultimate goal, it's actually the transformation that occurs on the journey that will truly last. Let's do this together!\n\n![Hero's Journey Illustration](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Heroesjourney.svg/640px-Heroesjourney.svg.png)\n\n## What Is the Hero's Journey?\n**The Hero's Journey** is a literary theory explaining the path most heroes travel. Once explored, it's easy to see the similarities between Luke Skywalker and Bilbo Baggins though their adventures are in totally different times and places. This series of challenges attempts to take you (the Hero) on a similar journey. By deciding on a single major project to complete, you will journey with allies and defeat enemies along the way.\n\nMost of the language used in the Challenge is allegorical. I find allies in looking through Pinterest or talking with real life friends. Enemies can be the weather, an unexpected set of circumstances or a real person blocking your progress. Like Bilbo, we can be content to sit at home and enjoy the life we have, or we can find that nagging sense of adventure that prompts us to get up and tackle challenges previously ignored.\n\n[**The Hero's Journey Act I - Separation**](https://habitica.com/challenges/3822308b-7090-4249-8872-9f08ad0e2b3b) is all about refining the project. We often think in terms of check boxes. But our adventure needs to seek fame, fortune or glory. No one is excited to hear about all the activities you completed, but we all want to hear about the adventure of discovery.\n\n[**The Hero's Journey Act II - Descent**](https://habitica.com/challenges/6d287082-9a54-464b-8920-f3bcee0d7c9e) is the heart of the adventure - turning every obstacle into a battle to be won, lost or avoided. This is where we make progress. But with a unique focus on a better lifestyle, the defeats are easier to handle and it makes more sense tackling the challenges.\n\n[**The Hero's Journey Act III - Return**](https://habitica.com/challenges/9fc1320d-0bb3-4362-b88b-69deb437494f) allows us to return but not as the same person we were before embarking on the journey. We celebrate the transformation and vow not to return to our previous habits because we have truly been transformed.\n\nSome examples might be: changing eating habits instead of just a diet, renovating a room to welcome a new member to the house, or my current project of building a fire pit to actually enjoy the garden with friends and not just weed it because it's overgrown. \n\nWhen you recount the steps along your journey, try to share the processes of transformation and not just the check list of progress. Star Wars and the Hobbit would be pretty boring if all they presented was a bullet list of accomplishments.",

This in turn, empowers us relate to ourselves and one another with compassion and ultimately create more peace in our lives and in our world.\n\n> To experience this yourself, you can visit [The Exercise](http://www.nycnvc.org/the-exercise-shifting-toward-compassion/).\n\n> **Our Public Challenge**: [Discover Compassionate Communication](https://habitica.com/challenges/d73ca5b2-eec2-4ac6-a1d6-9cc8617603c0)",

You can also feel free to share your primary wing, and your tri-type, and anything else you'd like to share. :)\n\nFor anyone who doesn't know, the Enneagram is a system of 9 different personality types, each with a core desire, core sin/flaw, and core fear that makes up their main motivation for what they do and how they do it. \n \n# The Foundation of Each Type: \n \n**1 - Reformer:** Their core desire is to be good, to be innocent, to be right. Their core fear is being wrong or bad, and their core sin is wrath/anger. \n\n**2 - Helper:** Their core desire is to be loved and appreciated. Their core fear is being unloved. Their core sin is pride. \n\n**3 - Performer:** Their core desire is to be successful and admired. Their core fear is being unsuccessful or being exposed as incompetent. Their core sin is deceit. \n\n**4 - Individualist:** Their core desire is to be unique, special, and authentic. Their core fear is being ordinary, or without identity. Their core sin is envy. \n\n**5 - Observer:** Their core desire is to be independent, competent, and knowledgeable. Their core fear is being incompetent. Their core sin is greed. \n\n**6 - Loyalist:** Their core desire is to be safe, prepared, and secure. Their core fear is being unsafe, unprepared, and without support. Their core sin is fear. \n\n**7 - Enthusiast:** Their core desire is to be have fun, to be happy, to be free. Their core fear is missing out, being deprived, and being trapped. Their core sin is gluttony. (Not limited to food) \n\n**8 - Challenger:** Their core desire is to have control, to protect themselves and their close family/friends. The core fear is being weak, being vulnerable, being controlled. Their core sin is lust. (Not as a sexual thing.) \n\n**9 - Peacemaker:** Their core desire is to have peace, to have harmony, to have stability. Their core fear is conflict and losing connection. Their core sin is sloth. \n \n\nSo this is all the basics, the core, and the foundation for the rest of the Enneagram, but there is so much more to the Enneagram. \n \n \n \nIf you have any questions, please ask me (you can use @Syberyah or you can PM me) and I will be more than happy to help. :) I definitely don't intend to be calling anyone out, and the Enneagram is certainly not just there to put you down for your fears and flaws. The Enneagram is rather a tool to understand yourself better, and to understand your friends and family better and where they're all coming from, so that you have fewer misunderstandings and miscommunications, and can generally get a long better. \n \n \n(Also here's a link to the Enneagram parody of Bohemian Rhapsody because it's great: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQnmM2XzLjk )",

This is Alex, founder of the guild. The win log is a method of productivity that is very special to me, and has helped me tremendously over the years in making work consistently feel fun, and to help me get more done, month, and year than I could have imagined.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI have shared this method with my company's team, with my friends, and everyone who has used it has gotten a great deal of value over it. The win log makes you eliminate the trap of planning instead of doing, eliminates procrastination, and makes work feel like a fun game instead of a boring chore you need to trudge through.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### What counts as a win log?\n\nYou can log anything as a win that took willpower to complete that is not a videogame or a task such as driving. This includes:\n\n\n• Running a meeting\n\n\n• Completing a homework assignment\n\n\n• Doing a workout\n\n\n• Studying or learning a new skill\n\n\n• Practicing an instrument\n\n\n• Solving a problem at work\n\n\nAnd much more. If you completed a task, you can share it in this guild alongside your fellow win loggers. Let's grow this community with our hard work, one logged win at a time! :muscle:",

      "description":"I have a simple challenge for you.\n\nIn the month of February, mail at least one item through the post every day it runs. Write a postcard, a letter, send a picture, or a cutting from a newspaper, or a fabric swatch.\n\n1. Write back to everyone who writes to you. This can count as one of your mailed items.\n\n2. All you are committing to is to mail 23 items. Why 23? There are four Sundays and one US holiday. In fact, you might send more than 23 items. You might develop a correspondence that extends beyond the month.\n\nWrite love letters, thank yous, or simply notes to say that you miss an old friend. Send a fabric swatch from your new dress. A feather you picked up while on a walk. Whatever it is, let yourself step away from the urgency of modern life and think about an audience of one. Think of it as sending 23 little gifts. And, who knows, you might enjoy going to the mail box again.\n\nFeeling intimidated? It’s fewer words than NaNoWriMo and I know how many of you do that. Join me in [The Month of Letters Challenge.](http://lettermo.com/)\n\nSincerely yours,\nMaryRobinette",

      "description":"It's a guild for people whose biggest fear is disappointing others. So far I've disappointed my teachers, my grandparents, my friends, and my boss and co-workers. Now I'm scared of any relationships because I might disappoint others. But the greatest damages are dealt when I disappoint myself. Every time I lower the bar, setting my own limits.\nTo become an 'appointer' instead of a disappointer, I've decided to dedicate myself to self-improvement. This guild is about improving yourself physically through energizing workouts and sports, intellectually through focused studying and reading, and ambitiously pursuing other goals; for me, meditation, coding, writing, traveling, cooking, playing guitar, and whatever is added in the future.\nIf there are others who want desperately to become an 'appointer', please, join this guild and share whatever thoughts, experiences, or advice you might have about self-improvement, relationships, how to set goals and achieve them, resilience, and how not to disappoint yourself, or how to get over self-disappointments.\n\nChallenge created by our guild member, @clagianni\n[:sparkles:2023 Wishes, Dreams, and Plans!](https://habitica.com/challenges/5fba0d4b-0dc2-4647-ae61-d41c01263020)",

Our community is founded on the principle of embracing responsible and mindful cannabis consumption while promoting a productive and balanced lifestyle.\n\nAt The High Society, we understand that individuals have different preferences and choices when it comes to cannabis use. We respect each member's decision to consume or abstain from it entirely. Our primary goal is to create a safe and supportive environment that fosters personal growth, creativity, and productivity, regardless of one's choice regarding cannabis.\n\nThrough open dialogue, educational resources, and supportive discussions, we strive to empower our members to make informed decisions about cannabis usage. We believe in promoting a culture of responsible consumption, where members can explore the benefits of cannabis without jeopardizing their overall well-being and responsibilities.\n\nOur guild's core values center around the pursuit of productivity and self-improvement. We encourage our members to set and achieve personal and professional goals, fostering a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment within the community. Whether it's excelling in a career, pursuing creative endeavors, or maintaining a healthy work-life balance, we support each other's aspirations and progress.\n\nBy sharing success stories, tips, and strategies for being a productive stoner, we hope to inspire others and change the perception of cannabis users in society. Through positive representation and responsible behavior, we aim to dispel the stereotypes that have long plagued the cannabis community.\n\nJoin us in The High Society, and let's pave the way for a new era of responsible and productive stoners, promoting understanding, unity, and a brighter future together! 🌿🚀",

At this link, you can look through the previous year's **winning images.**\n\n+ [**Bad Astronomy**](http://syfy.com/badastronomy) is a **blog** by astronomer Phil Plait about real-world science, covering the entire Universe from subatomic particles to the Big Bang: astronomy, space exploration, the effect of politics on science, etc. (This blog may move. The current location is likely to be linked from [Phil Plait's Twitter profile](https://twitter.com/badastronomer).)\n\n+ [**Cloudy Nights**](https://www.cloudynights.com/) has some astronomy articles, but the gold here are reviews of **stargazing/space photography equipment** and techniques to use such equipment. Want to know how to use a DSLR to take a picture of a comet? Is the Hubble Optics 14\" Dobsonian telescope any good? Do you want to be able to use your phone to tell you if your scope is pointing in the right direction? Cloudy Nights can help you find the answers to these and other questions.\n\n+ [**Crash Course Astronomy**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtPAJr1ysd5yGIyiSFuh0mIL) is a **video series** by Phil Plait on YouTube.\n\n+ [**EarthSky**](https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/), among other things, gives useful **information of upcoming events** like meteor showers and visible planets in the night sky.\n\n+ [**Heavens Above**](https://www.heavens-above.com/main.aspx) is a terrific resource **showing what is in the night sky.** You can see star charts, planet charts, plus a live view of what's overhead now (like sattelites and the ISS). There's also a link to the Heavens Above Android app, so you can take this wherever you have cell service.\n\n+ [**In-The-Sky.org**](https://in-the-sky.org/) has various resources and can show you **local stargazing info.**\n\n+ [**NASA website**](https://www.nasa.gov/) about all things NASA. Linked and featured there you can find among others:  \n  + You can track [**NASA's Artemis I Mission**](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/track-nasa-s-artemis-i-mission-in-real-time) around the moon in real time.\n  + At [**NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day**](https://apod.nasa.gov/) (APOD) each day a different image or photograph is featured, along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer.\n  + The [**NASA Expolanet Archive**](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/) lets you explore the database of known exoplanets.\n  + At [**NASA's Expolanets website**](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/) you can learn a lot about exoplanets.\n  + At [**NASA Image and Video Library**](https://images.nasa.gov/) you can search through all their images, videos, and audio clips.\n  + [**NASA's Image of the Day**](https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/iotd.html) (IOTD) shows daily images as well, but these are not necessarily as space-specific as the APOD's.\n\n+ [**Night Sky Network**](https://nightsky.jpl.nasa.gov/) is primarily interesting for people in the USA. It has a listing of **USA astronomy clubs** and resources for doing outreach.\n\n+ [**Sky and Telescope**](https://skyandtelescope.org/) is a great website for **amateur astronomers.** It has everything, from what to watch for to how to pick and use a telescope that meets your needs. It's free, although it has extras if you're a subscriber.\n\n+ [**Space.com**](https://www.space.com/) is a great website for **amateur astronomers.** Among other things, it has videos of our space exploration. You can also subscribe to their monthly \"All About Space\" magazine.\n\n+ [**Spaceweather**](https://spaceweather.com/) provides news and information about the **Sun-Earth environment.** It's obviously related to space, less to astronomy, but very much of interest to amateur radio operators.\n\n+ [**Stellarium**](https://stellarium-web.org/) is a **free open source planetarium.** It shows a realistic sky in 3D, just like what you see with the naked eye, binoculars or a telescope. It can be viewed online and it is available as [apps for Android and iOS](https://www.stellarium-labs.com/stellarium-mobile-plus/) (free and paid versions) and it can be downloaded to your [laptop or PC](http://stellarium.org/) as well.\n___\n[@dicedweller](https://habitica.com/profile/1643f1c4-3199-47b6-b0fc-99a3e567c092) became the new guild leader after [@ItsCal](https://habitica.com/profile/70a69870-46f8-4ddd-bd67-289a7ecdc55d) in december 2022.",

We are always at risk for burnout, compassion fatigue and over-extending ourselves. When we are under greater stress, we sometimes neglect our own needs. But is at those times when it is even more important to prioritize taking care of ourselves, so we can also continue to show up for those who depend on us. Let's come together here to share resources and encourage one another as we continue to support others.\n\nFeel free to share resources and suggest challenges!\n\nResources:\n(NOTE: This is a very small start.

We thought we could do with a space to chat about writing away from the main guild.\n\n\n### First and foremost, a reminder: \n\n* You don't need a professional diagnosis. If you have self-diagnosed with ADHD, or suspect you may have it, you're welcome here. \n* If you consider yourself a writer, you're a writer. You don't have to be published anywhere, you don't even need ambitions to be published! \n* It doesn't matter what you write, that counts. Fiction, non-fiction, poetry, fanfiction, blog posts, flash, etc.  \n\n\nWe can often struggle to stick with grand plans to write daily, meet self-imposed word-counts, and rarely see ourselves represented in the apparently \"necessary\" writing practices that all successful writers supposedly stuck to. \n\nThis is a place to come together to discuss (ie. complain about) the hurdles we have to jump over to get the words down on the page, to share tips and tricks which might work for others, and celebrate each others' achievements no matter how small or large. \n\n\nThere's no pressure to post often, the great thing about the ADHD community is that we understand each other in ways those without ADHD don't! We dip in and out of things, we forget what's not right in front of our faces, we get overwhelmed, we hyperfocus on something and then are bored of it for months on end. You're welcome here as often/infrequently as you wish. Like a neighbour who comes over for tea every day, or a cousin who lives in another country and reminds you they're alive every three years! ",

Then finding no such Guild for Berlin, I figure its time someone get the ball rolling!\n\nChallenges will include a mix of those intended to get people better acquainted with the city and feel welcome, socially active, fighting fit, language skill improvement and on top of possibly a smattering of pop culture/ gaming challenges because, well, because I'm a massive geek n I find that s*** fun. \n\nWalk on in, make yourself at home and let me know who you are!

What we do with this hour, and that one, is what we are doing. A schedule defends from chaos and whim. It is a net for catching days. It is a scaffolding on which a worker can stand and labor with both hands at sections of time. A schedule is a mock-up of reason and order—willed, faked, and so brought into being; it is a peace and a haven set into the wreck of time; it is a lifeboat on which you find yourself, decades later, still living. Each day is the same, so you remember the series afterward as a blurred and powerful pattern.\" *Annie Dillard*  \n\n-----\n\n![9 @Foxglove13](https://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/5f251b8bdd2f9a5515726abc/380x381/f114f9038d977c0071e5055cc999b44a/9_Resized.png)  \n\n**Hall Of Fame**  \n\nCongratulations to previous challenge prize winners, forever honoured in the Hall Of Fame!  \n\n`@_jasonnor @_missluna_ @-and-peggy- @101-Alien @18FlouroDeoxyGlucose @4ndr3w1 @A_me @Acorn_Sprout @adbenturetime @aethelflaeda @AK_the_Legend @akche10 @akverbatim @AlarmQueen @alexps @alixcia @all-usernames-taken @alyash808 @amazingpuppy @Anjara @Archmage_Ephraim @arieshagem @Arilius @aurasphere @Auspicati @Aybreezy @Bababoo227 @bactathefuture @bakkens76 @Barida @Bear09 @becpotato @Bensonfm @Beth-Star16 @BigFatGoalie @BirchHeart @Blargbot @blastyboi25 @Blue_Rope @BlueFlames389 @Boyz @Brandiontherocks @Brave_Orchid @briannam @Bruno_Hellyeah @BrynLeretu @caitiebear @carrotsss @cez_ka @chaotic-fia @chimax7 @CiaraTheMage @clarvia @CluelessOwl @CoderCat13 @Coltocas @communeofwallabieslo @Cryo_Fate @DaisyChain420 @darc-star @DarkLord834 @Datachick @Dd_DoodleBomb_Bb @deiandorinha @delyoku @Dioneo @Durotos @EarlDizon @eldritchfrog @Elskars @emalehboolynx @emoryfar @Enaro @EnchantedWaffles @Ephraim_Prime @Epic_bunny @Estris__ @EvilPaperclip @FINKLEFISH @fiotag18 @Fionnicorn @floructivity @foohie @forest-flame @Foxfire_18 @Foxglove13 @Foxyloxy @FunnyRabbit87 @Gardath @Gavi06 @georgia_raventiger @gg_cstrd @GG7787 @GlitterBomb5 @GrimmMorning @gustavo-dgs @HabitFighterNow @hanu-adhu @Hazazeu @HazelLevesque @hb-5apxwywr0mai51kmw @hb-9w9rzo1bjbuxomw7u @hb-ew5e02llr8qwkw7o0 @HeatherNicole @HelenaB @hermione3 @Hi1123 @Iamgmm @iamjune @IAmProductive @ihse_ruqrubma @Iloliini @Imzaadi @Inamori_Asuto @infamousmars @InkyViolinist @ivancojr @IzzoT @jakub03 @jameswillish @Janzilyn @Jemsina @jjgame83 @jollivander @jrosemarsh @JtW529 @juniorkeeper12 @jusauria @JustyB @kane2742 @kath_0 @kirikaguya @kiskavics @kkohler @Kuriname @ladyindigo @LadyJuliana @LadyOctarina @LatentWanderer @laylaberry @LaziestDragon @LeOnTan @Let_The_Past_Die @Lexie @lgene @LindyBlues @lindypurist @livblatt @lothlorienluna @Lunarflare @MadeInCanada @madeliefequelsdaisy @Madison_Grace @Maggie2112 @MalWolf @mauve_m @Maximenote @MCM01 @Mekachu04 @MeloneGuy @MightyMeaty @MissLadyArtemis @mlcr @moellis @Mokiwoki @Ms_Chanandler_Bong @muddymaesuggins @MyaApplesauce @MystaryPi @MysticBelle @nadzilla @Nedscoop @NerdyWizard @NickyBeatnik @NicNicholasK @NikkiG-Wagon @nobodyyy @no-brain_no-pain @NotSomeone @novalunosis_pride @Oatmeals @omiseru @paaulaxx @Pandawalker @PavanHeb @peculiarluculia @Perinolo @phantomess @Pienk_Drakie @pockifish @pzex @qafkaesque @queen_allie @Queen_Satana @RA9_101_303 @random_person123 @rangerboy369 @RawrrrOwO @Riddywipple @RosaDraconis @Rose810 @Reesethegrumpycat @Regina-Phalange @Remicity @RoboDude13 @rookksan @Roxyfoxy300 @Rrebecca @RyotGrrrl @Ryxzaine @Saiwa @Sasha-Joy @SaturnXI @scorlight @Shadow_Temper @ShaeBear @Sho_Kiz @SiJulia @Sir_Goodfellow @SirSullivan @Sloth_Hut @smiley1 @snowcrystal @Snowyfoxx @Snowzy @Sodacane @Soff21 @sofipofi @sooshi_vombat @spamber85 @starchildicanbe @Strawberry-Bunny @SunsrikeCat @supercleaner @SuperSaraA @synitheia @TangledStars4Life @Tanks4Dat2 @Tashi123 @TatteredClothes @the_cavystorm @the-wanderer-bard @The4077thFan @TheAskabathian @theSMG @TheTriumphantLobster @TheWhiteRider @thewickedEvelyn @TravellingLobster @Vaishnavi_2003 @void_girl_lives @waltzingrose @whiterose4001 @wooginator @x4ojM @X6 @Xaina @xikstash @XLonE @xxDynastyxx @Ylvidera @Yoshisan @Your_highness @yukkuri @Zdenka @zephyro97 @Zetatata`  \n\n----\n\n![3 @theSMG](https://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/5fa959d6158dac31f68515e1/380x380/26853bd9f674c4b88b1837c174bb2d81/3_Resized.png)",

Some of the most common BFRBs are:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* Hair-pulling (trichotillomania)\n* Skin-picking (dermatillomania/excoriation disorder)\n* Nail-biting (onychophagia)\n* Mouth-chewing and lip-biting\n* Compulsive joint-cracking\n* Compulsive nose-picking\n* And others\n\nIt is normal to have multiple BFRBs of varying severity. You can read more about BFRBs at [The TLC Foundation for BFRBs](https://www.bfrb.org/index.php). Need ideas on how to combat your BFRB? Check out [Tips from our Members!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q4CL3I0IXWqEZWVNSHvQl7d42dnrNh5kRmrfUQb94Bs/edit?usp=sharing) (Feel free to add yours!)

We are coming together to create a world that works for all people and all species of life on Earth.\n \nThe Novasutras movement is about co-creating celebrations and a community to nurture and uplift each other during these challenging times. In this movement, spirituality and science are honored harmoniously to understand our existence, open our minds, expand our hearts, and guide us into action.\n\nThe Novasutras community promotes [agaya and ubuntu](https://novasutras.org/what-are-agaya-and-ubuntu/). Agaya is a new term, intended as an expression of the deep, sacred beauty of the universe. Ubuntu is a term that represents the connections between all things, binding us all together in the more-than-human world with reverence, joy, generosity, gratitude, and loving-kindness. We invite the power of community to transform global civilizations into expressions of Novasutras’ [core values](https://novasutras.org/core-principles-and-values/), so we begin to abide in a world of ubuntu and agaya.\n\nLearn more about the movement at [Novasutras.org](https://novasutras.org/).\nSearch terms (please suggest more in the chat): deep ecology, ecospirituality, earth spirit, interconnected, interdependence, complexity, activism, engaged spirituality, nature religion",

      "description":"## [Quran 83:26] So for that (Paradise) let the competitors compete ##\n\nIn Sūratul Mutaffifīn (chapter 83) Allah ‘azza wa-jall describes the bounties of Heaven. He mentions the pure drink that will be given to the people in Heaven and then says that is what people should aspire towards and compete with each other in. \n\nThe word tanāfus (used in verse 26 of Sūratul Mutaffifīn) refers to the desire and efforts of two people who each wish to also possess a prized possession of the other. It is healthy competition not based on jealousy but on an understanding of the value of the desired goal. It includes a hope to reach the status of the other without anything being diminished for that other person. Healthy competition inspires people to aspire more and do their best. It enhances motivation and gets people engaged and enthusiastic. When done nobly and sincerely it brings about excellence in the attempted goal.\n\nOne of the aims of the Quran is to create a humane and virtuous society. Its teachings emphasize social virtues and guide the believers to form a society in which good flourishes. Through that the well-being of each member is achieved. In encouraging its followers towards good, verses of Quran talk about rushing towards good as well as competing with each other to attain good. Apart from the above verse this concept can be seen in Sūratul Hadīd: \n\n## [Quran 57:21] Take the lead (sābiqū) towards forgiveness from your Lord and a paradise as vast as the heavens and the earth, prepared for those who have faith in Allah and His apostles ##\n\nand in Sūratul Baqarah: \n\n##  [Quran 2:148] Each of you chooses the direction to follow; you shall race towards righteousness. Wherever you may be, God will summon you all. God is Omnipotent. ##\n\nWith that being said. Lets all help each other become better Muslims through friendly competition and mutual motivation. Salamualaykum everyone!!!\n\n# Have FUN and WELCOME to the Guild #\n\n## CHALLENGE RULES ##\n\n1. I will post some of the bigger challenges and their winners on my YouTube channel. However it is NOT necessary to subscribe:\nwww.youtube.com/MrMiddlepath\n\n2. Please follow all challenge rules. \n\n3. If you want to create a challenge please make sure you follow the challenge creation guidelines set in the Habitica Running a challenge page. See:\nhttps://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Running_a_Challenge webpage\n**(Muslim advice: Please make sure to enable reading mode or turn your adblocker on. Fandom pages often have very inappropriate or sexual ads. That being said, the link above has very clear details on how to create a challenge)**\n\n4. Please make sure that the challenges are beneficial and make sense to put in a Muslim challenge group. For example a pushup challenge is great because many hadith remind us to be strong. Quran challenge would of course make sense. A challenge to finish Harry Potter books would probably be better suited for a different guild loll.\n\n4. Please make sure nobody else made a similar challenge before posting your own.\n\n5. The Guildmaster has the right to veto and delete any challenges which don't meet the guidelines, are inappropriate for a Muslim audience or are duplicate.\n\n## [Quran 23:61] They are eager to do righteous works; they compete in doing them. ##\n\n## RULES OF CONVERSATION ##\n\n1. Please keep chatting about non-challenge related topics to a minimum as the servers only allow the last 200 messages to show. If you want friendly conversation head on over to the other guild: Muslims of Habitica\n\n1. No Political discussion. Don't talk about political discussions on this forum as it is NOT the place for it. \n\n2. No Sectarian debate: No Salafi - Sufi debates here (again I don't care what side of the debate your on - doesn't matter.)\n\n3. No Mawlid debates: Having run large group chats before, Mawlid spirals into a debate from the realms of chaos. Everyone celebrates both Eids but Not everyone celebrates Mawlid so just respect that and be silent about it. \n\n4. Don't feed the trolls: \nDon't instigate sensitive topics or respond to instigators. Check Habitica guidelines for a detailed list of their guidelines (especially lgbt topics). Don't ask questions or instigate debates that you know could get the group in trouble. For more information please see:\nhttps://habitica.com/static/community-guidelines\n\n5. If you want to share hadith make sure that it is a verified authentic hadith. (no exceptions)\n\n6. Be friendly and respectful. Lighthearted motivational \"trash-talking\" may be acceptable if its motivational in nature and obviously a joke but never put down or mock anybody else (that is haram)",

      "description":"\nHello! Welcome to the Minecraft Role Play! We're pretty small at the moment, so that means a lot of individual  attention for everyone!\n___________\n# Role Play information\n\n`we've all agreed on a plot, and here it is! We'll incorporate A bunch of other stuff, but this is @K_Leeridiot 's idea, which the RP in this guild will be based on.`\n\n### @K_leeridiot: \n\nMy idea is rather simple, but effective. We each come from different backgrounds (can be half-mob like in the Origins mod) and we all find a village at the same time, then upon speaking with one another, we find out there's other worlds (or some of us already know of these realms).\n\nFor instance, characters A, B, and C can find the village and chat, then soon discover the Nether (maybe after a few days?) and find character D, a half-mob or somebody who got lost in the Nether\n\nAnd for the End, we discover it due to a bunch of poems and books written by an unknown author, and decide to work together and find this Stronghold\n\nIt can have a bunch of events in between too, like discoveries of monuments, taking time to get look, sharing background stories (like tragic or sweet ones) and being attacked by mobs.\n\nAnother idea I had was that the characters have to find the Stronghold and escape to the End because the Overworld is decaying.\n\n___________\n# Intro\n\n*You wake up. You're in a daze, and aren't completely conscious. You try to remember where you are, who you are, and suddenly all your memories come back at once. You remember your name your past, but... the memories are strange, like... They're someone else's. But not wanting to get into a conspiracy theory about being in a simulation, you push the thought to the back of your mind. Now, to figure out where you are. As you think this, you suddenly realize that you are falling at an alarming rate. You start to panic, and try something, ANYTHING to make you fall slower, but nothing is working. And as you close your eyes tight, and begin to think that this is the end, the ground finally comes up to meet you. Upon opening your eyes, you realize you somehow survived. Relieved, you get up and begin to look around.*\n\n___________\n# RP Etiquette\n\nExample post:\n\n//@11gaming YAAAAASS Lasagna is the BEST\n\n*Mittens the cat peered into the lava pool, thinking of fish, and wondering if she would ever get out of the nether and go fishing again. Then, she noticed a player behind her, saying,* \"Hello little fella, how'd you get down here?\"\n\n\"I honestly don't know how I got into this horrid place.\" *she replied.* \"And I'd love to get back home. I rather think this place is quite horrible. D' you happen to know the way to a portal?\" *but alas, the player had fainted at the discovery this cat could speak.* \"What's the point of talking to me if you don't expect an answer? Honestly...\" \n\n//talking out of character.\n\n*narrative*(*)\n\n\"Talking in character.\"\n\n___________\n# characters \n\n`We can't Start the RP until everyone has a character. Tell @11gaming about your character in the chat, or in PMs.`\n\n**@11gaming:** a half cat, named 11. His fur is Orange, with white fur on his tummy, paws, and tail tip. He also has a Mario hat with holes for his ears.\n\n**@justadvena** Rye: A sentimental magma cube. Although they prefers roaming the world as a slightly-larger-than-normal magma cube, they are able to form a humanoid appearance at wish, with facial features put together by dark red slime and holes for eyes and mouth, through which their bright yellow inside can be seen.\n\n**@princesspenn** an enderman named rhinestone\n\n**@MaesieDaisy:** Maesie, a polar bear separated from her mother bear and trying to find her way back to the artic (she’s not a baby anymore, she’s was separated from her mother a long time ago) once she helps her friends with whatever their trying to do, she’ll try to go home.\n\n**@Cryo_Fate:** Dor, The enderman\n\n**@RubyFlareon:** Red, a half dragon\n\n**@K-Leeridot:** a half jackrabbit that goes by Kayla. She likes to trade, and will build stuff/gather materials as long as she gets something in return. Her experience in business makes her apt for running a market (if that's ever built)\n\n**also @K-leeridot** Cloud, a Phantom, so he'll only appear at night. Cloud is larger than most Phantoms, and figured out how to blend in with crowds at night, on foot. He has a cloak in his inventory to put on and appear as a Player, or at least, an Enderman at best. He'd be more of a side character, and help watch over the group and ensure they don't get attacked by mobs at night, while they're traveling. Of course, Cloud's not always going to be available where they go, such as the Nether, underground caves, underwater, or even the End.\n\n**@arensolin:** Melchior the giant grumpy goth chicken. About 7 feet tall, about 400 pounds, can't fly, doesn't have any powers other than being extremely durable, occasionally setting fire to things and shedding feathers all over the place. Hits his head on ceilings a lot. Please dig your mining tunnels at least 3 blocks high or you will make Melchior sad.\n\n**@EnderCat2860:** Endercat, half cat half human who likes end stuff.\n\n**@5torr:** Storr the dead Yeti, leader of the Dead Yetis, currently wandering around alone because she got separated from the other yetis whilst escaping Underworld/The Nether. \n\n**@Jessalinfinler** Ashburn, she is part human, part blaze. She has the face and body of a human with golden skin, and strawberry blonde hair that seems to be blown by a nonexistent breeze. She floats about a half a block above the ground, and has nine blazerodes around her. She is usually partially covered in ash, and soulsand.she hasn't quite mastered fire breathing. Is extremely sensitive to water and lower tempetures.\n\n**@Dragonchild:** TheDragonChild, an interdimensional traveler who helps people in order to complete their 'story' as he calls it and then asks for help in his dimension as it's in the middle of a magical war. He's all powerful but rarely uses his powers preferring to fight normally and is very mysterious and cryptic. He looks like a teen with blond hair blacks scales on his arms and legs and black wings when he fight or is angered his right eye has a purple iris and his left eye is completely black otherwise his eyes are blue\n\n___________\n# Crafting Recipes\n\nIn the RP, we currently know how to make:\n\nWooden tools, planks, sticks, crafting tables, fishing rods, doors, chests, blocks of ores, furnaces, wool blocks, stairs, beds, and stone pickaxes!\n___________\n# Gaming\n\n`there is nothing scheduled at the moment. If you want to schedule a time to play Minecraft or whatever other game, please PM @11gaming`\n\n___________\n# Portals\n\n`want to see some other guilds like this one? Check these cool guilds out!`\n\n### [Minecrafters](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/db4c31eb-a1d4-4a9a-b692-16856869fd55) \n\n*suggest a server, do some Minecraft themed challenges, or even just talk about Minecraft!*",

      "description":"Osteoporosis means porous bones that weaken and can fracture with even minor incidents. 55% of people 50 and older have osteoporosis or reduced bone mass and often don't know it until that first fracture. However, you can live with osteoporosis for a long, long time and never have complications such as fractures -- if you take certain precautions.\n\nGet plenty of calcium. Calcium gives bone its hardness and is very important for bone strength. Aim for 1,000 milligrams of dietary calcium per day if you're younger than 50 or a man age 50 to 70. Women age 50 and older and men age 71 and older need a total of 1,200 milligrams daily, according to the National Osteoporosis Foundation. That translates to three servings of high-calcium foods like milk, yogurt, cheese, or calcium-fortified citrus juice or cereal. Vitamin D is essential for the proper absorption of calcium, so make sure you get enough Vitamin D also.\n\nEngaging in certain forms of exercise can also improve the strength and density of your bones. Weight-bearing exercise (such as walking), stepping (as long as there is no fall risk) doing resistance training with tension bands are all beneficial. Improving your balance is crucial to avoid the risk of falls and fractures, so activities such as yoga (as long as you avoid spine twisting poses) or tai chi are especially helpful.",

Break them down into actionable steps.\n2) Monitor progress, get feedback whenever you can\n3) Try to find a perfect ratio of skill/challenge\n\n__________________________\n\n\n## **How to get into the flow (long version):**\n\n**1**\\. **Clear goals** and sub goals/steps\n\n\"When you have clear goals, your mind doesn’t have to wonder what to do next. You know what you’re doing and why you’re doing it. Also, don’t focus on the finish line, focus on running the race, the NOW, the present moment. Many are getting distracted by their past, future, or self. Focus on the clarity of your goals. It gives you certainty.\"[4]\n\n\n**2**\\. **Immediate feedback** \n\n\"This trigger is a partner with clear goals. Clear goals tell us what we’re doing, immediate feedback tells us how to do it better. If we know how to improve performance in real time, the mind doesn’t go off in search of clues for betterment.\"[4]\n\nMonitor your progress in accordance with the goals (it's easier if the progress is visible). Ask the opinions of others if you need to. Habitica gives you some feedback when you check your tasks as done.\n\n**3**\\. The main concept of the flow is to try to achieve that **skill vs challenge** ratio, so that you feel challenged but not overwhelmed. \n\n![alt text](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Challenge_vs_skill.svg \"Challenge vs. skill\") \n\n## **Skill vs challenge ratio**: \n\n   - **If the task is too easy (and you feel bored)** you can increase challenge/difficulty in order to keep it interesting (Challenge **\":snowboarder: :dart: :heavy_check_mark: Just get it done\"**): \n      - increase speed, \n      - increase quality of work \n      - add a goal to find ways to enjoy the task (e.g. put some nice music), etc.\n\n   - **If the task is too difficult (and you feel anxious/frustrated or even feel like you might burn out)** you can decrease challenge/difficulty (Challenge **\":snowboarder: :dart: :arrow_lower_right: Making a hard task easier\"**): \n      - You can do it by breaking the tasks into manageable pieces (smaller steps/sub-goals), \n      - Work in your comfortable pace \n      - make a break when you start getting frustrated or tired,                                           \n      - ask for help if you need to, etc. \n\n   - **Don't work past your limit (to avoid burn out)**, but think of ways to move your limit. ( Challenge **\":snowboarder: :dart: :rocket: HARDCORE productivity\"**) \n\nYou can find these challenges in the description of this guild\n__________________________\n\n## **Dealing with a multitude of tasks (including difficult ones) (example)**\n\n**1\\.** Sort your tasks using [The Urgent Important Matrix](https://www.thecoachingtoolscompany.com/coaching-tools-101-what-is-the-urgent-important-matrix/) to minimize amount of tasks to focus on and to see the bigger picture ![alt text](https://tools.thecoachingtoolscompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Urgent-Important-Matrix-GRAPHIC-ONLY.jpg \"Urgent_vs_Important\")\n\n**2\\.** Create **tag \"focus now\"** (or with a similar name) to use when you need to focus (captain obvious at your service hehe). Put this tag on **7-10 tasks** max (all of which could be \"Habits\" and \"Dailies\" from Flow challenges ;p) and **just one \"To-Do\"** (the one that you need to focus on right now). \n\n**3\\.** This **\"To-Do\" task should be stated clearly** (clear goal). It's better to break it into clear **sub-goals and steps** (especially for hard tasks). Writing on paper usually works better, there's also some science behind it ;). \n\n**4\\.** Every time you **complete** one step or achieve one sub-goal, I click on **habit \":heavy_check_mark: I got it done\"** from the challenge [:snowboarder: :dart: :heavy_check_mark: Just get it done](https://habitica.com/challenges/f310f7e0-25b0-49ea-a284-7ee5708bb99d). You can also put the :heavy_check_mark: in front of the step or sub-goal on paper with a thick marker of your preferred color.\n__________________________\n\n## **Got questions? Ask!**\n\nPlease don't hesitate to ask in the guild! There are no dumb questions, we are keeping an open mind here. \n\nKeep me in the Flow as a leader of the guild, give me your feedback if smth is not clear (2-nd condition of the Flow) ;)\n\nThe FAQ article is coming soon...\n__________________________\n\n**People who have experienced flow, describe the following feelings:**\n\n- Completely involved in what we are doing - focused, concentrated.\n- A sense of ecstasy - of being outside everyday reality.\n- Great inner clarity - knowing what needs to be done, and how well we are doing.\n- Knowing that the activity is doable - that our skills are adequate to the task.\n- A sense of serenity - no worries about oneself, and a feeling of growing beyond the boundaries of the ego.\n- Timelessness - thoroughly focused on the present, hours seem to pass by the minute.\n- Intrinsic motivation - whatever produces flow becomes it own reward.[2]\n__________________________\n\n## **Disclaimer:**\n\nI am not a therapist, a psychiatrist or a psychologist. I do not assume any responsibility regarding your psychological state and anything regarding it. I merely try to provide some information and it is up to you what you do with it.\n\nThe same can be said regarding the challenges I create.

I personally like \"Focus\". Even though it crashes a lot and acts a bit glitchy, it's very customizable (I once did 17 minute minutes of work with a 3-minute short interval and a 12-minute long one). Be focused also works very well; you can make different categories and see how many Poms you completed in each one, but it only lets you select the length of your Pom in intervals of 5.* (Review by Dorkkunckle the Incredulous @hijodeganas112279)\n__________________________\n\n**Many thanks for contributing sources to:**\n\n- Arnavi Weiwei, a warrior of soul**\n- Niklaus Grädel\n- Dorkkunckle the Incredulous @hijodeganas112279\n- GeminiForce @GeminiForce\n\n__________________________\n\n**Donations are Always Welcome ;)**\n\nWe will be grateful for every :gem: \n\nHow to donate gem: \n\n**1**\\.

(Jordyward23)\nA: I'm not sure I can fully define the purpose but my personal vision is that productivity doesn't have to be forced and that's only about finding out *\"how\" to find paths/directions of less resistance for the processes that we want to be happening in order to achieve our goals*. For me, personally, it also means learning to be a kind friend to myself in terms of understanding what I need/want, what are my strengths and weaknesses (without judgment) and how to make my life worth living in terms of quality and meaning. \n\n",

All types of service dogs (well, their handlers!) are welcome here, including:\n* Psychiatric Service Dogs\n* Seeing Eye Dogs\n* Diabetic Alert Dogs\n* Cardiac Alert Dogs\n* Other Medical Alert Dogs\n* Hearing Dogs\n\nYou're welcome to join even if you don't currently have a service dog or service dog in training (SDIT) but are considering taking that route!\n\nThis is a place to discuss training and the ups and downs of having a service dog, as well as to have service dog-related challenges.\n\n**Important:** Although emotional support animals (ESAs) are valid, this guild is primarily for discussing service dogs: that is, dogs that are specifically trained in public access and trained to perform tasks to mitigate the effects of their handler's disability, or dogs in training to do those things.  In the United States, ESAs are protected under the Fair Housing Act but do not have public access rights, while service dogs have full access rights.  This means that the things SD handlers deal with are going to be very different from the things ESA handlers deal with.  This guild is for service dog handlers and not ESA handlers, although if you are an ESA handler we're happy to answer questions you have about having a service dog, especially if you're considering training your ESA as a Psychiatric SD!",

Everyone is Valid. Even if you haven't heard of it or it doesn't sound like a \"\"real\"\" thing to you, you don't get to tell other people what they are or are not.\n2. Questions asked in good faith are fine, but endless \"what ifs\", and obvious gotchas are not.\n3. Be sensitive in your use of language. Be accurate and avoid slang terms used in pornography as these can have de-humanizing and harmful implications. When in doubt, use the bigger words or check a wiki.\n4. Everyone gets *one* warning. The warning will be DM'd to you, and you will be asked to delete your post or end the conversation. If you do not, you will be removed. Since I will be DMing you, I will know if you have been warned before and your second warning will be a removal from the Guild.\n5. We're all adults here, please act like it.",

Why is this? No, it's not *just* because they're pompous or need to look good for the camera. In fact, for many of these people their good habits in this realm are what helped propel them to their current level of success. Good habits in this realm teach us how to be consistent, reinforce our dedication to our routines (because people *will* begin to compliment you, regularly, on your appearance, and most importantly, teach us to love ourselves, and to take care of ourselves, as we are the most important thing we can invest in for the good of everything we interact with.

You'll gain six stats that grow over time and represent your real life attributes. Then you get to explore dungeons, slay monsters, and earn titles!\n\nThe first step to your D&D adventure, is to join the [\"Dungeons and Dailies\"](https://habitica.com/challenges/7272f913-a741-4931-9f3d-fc9d3160f633) challenge.

It was created to be similar to Dungeons & Dragons, one of the more popular TTRPGs. It sets itself apart from other challenges in Habitica because it follows your real-life abillities and skills over time, giving you a direct look at your progress. It was also made with the purpose of developing well-roundedness in an individual.\n\n\n## Habits\n\nThere are two different categories of habits in this challenge, Attribute habits, and Other habits. Attribute habits are each meant to serve as a sort of “experience bar.” When you develop that habit, you click its plus. When you make negative progress, you click its minus. As you develop this habit, it will move closer to becoming “bright blue.” Once it is bright blue, you have gained a point in that attribute! As a reward, you should click the “Loot!” habit three times. Then you should add a point to the Attribute To-do that matches it. Finally, you should delete the Attribute habit and replace it, so that it is no longer bright blue and you can try to level it up again.\n\t\nYou develop different habits by doing different kinds of activities. The kinds of activities are as follows.\n\nStrength: Athletics and physical activity.\n\nConstitution: Health and hygiene.\n\nDexterity: Practicing skills and trying new things.\n\nIntelligence: Paperwork and literature.\n\nWisdom: Chores and spirituality.\n\nCharisma: Socializing and altruism.\n\nThe other habits are called “Loot!” and “Damage!” They are used for general rewards and punishment. You are to click “Loot!” When you do something positive that doesn’t fit elsewhere in your habits. You may also use it when someone thanks you or sincerely compliments you. You are to click “Damage!” when you do something negative that doesn’t fit in your habits elsewhere. You may also use it to punish yourself for cheating.\n\n## To-dos\n\nWhereas your Attribute habits are made to represent how close you are to improving your real world ability, your Attribute To-dos represent your current real-world ability. The to-dos here are meant to display your D&D attributes so you may compare them to each-other or with other players. When a habit has become bright blue, you add one point to the correct Attribute To-do. You may make a 30 point checklist to keep track of each attribute, or you may write the number in the information section of the to-do. You start with seven points in each attribute already. This is to make the challenge attributes more similar to Dungeons & Dragons attributes. The highest you can raise an attribute is thirty. \n\n## Titles\n\nTitles are a kind of reward gained through D&D. You may add any title you possess as a suffix after your Habitica profile name. They are mainly gained through two methods. One is by earning them in a D&D adventure module. The adventure module you are in will tell you how to get one if available. The second and more common method is through raising your attributes. Raising any attribute to eight, gives you the title, “The Beginner.” Achieving different levels in different stats gives you increasingly prestigious titles. These titles are gained at these levels in these stats:\n\nStrength: \n\n10 The Scrapper\n15 The Brawler\n20 The Fighter\n25 The Berserker\n30 The Slayer &nbsp;\n\nConstitution: \n\n10 The Page\n15 The Squire\n20 The Soldier\n25 The Knight\n30 The Champion \n\nDexterity: \n\n10 The Scoundrel\n15 The Burglar\n20 The Scout\n25 The Rogue\n30 The Vigilante \n\nIntelligence:\n\n10 The Student\n15 The Apprentice\n20 The Journeyman\n25 The Wizard\n30 The Arch-mage \n\nWisdom:\n\n10 The Adherant\n15 The Disciple\n20 The Healer\n25 The Cleric\n30 The Saint\n\nCharisma: \n\n10 The Dreamer\n15 The Changeling\n20 The Bard\n25 The Sorceror\n30 The Fey\n\n## Adventure Modules\n\nAdventure Modules are challenges made to integrate with the basic “D&D” challenge. They typically come in sets of three challenges, Challenge 1, Challenge 2, and a BOSS BATTLE. Winning a BOSS BATTLE challenge earns you a title. Adventure Modules usually include three things. A set of dailies that serve as enemies, a habit called “Roll die!” used to defeat enemies, and some way to “win” the challenge. Usually a challenge is won by successfully slaying all enemies for one week, or defeating the boss. Sometimes winning an Adventure Module challenge allows you access to another challenge.\n\nThe first thing you will read in an Adventure Module daily, is its description. This provides flavor and story to the adventure. \n\nThe second thing you will see is which habit you need to develop to roll a die. All the dailies are won with a die roll, but different dailies have different ways to roll that die. Most dailies have a specific Attribute Habit you need to click to roll the die. Each time you develop the corresponding habit, you may roll to try to beat the daily. Each roll only counts for one daily, no multiple kills with one roll.\n\nRoll the die by simply clicking the “Roll die!” habit. On the mobile version this doesn’t work, so you can roll a real die, or find a dice roller on the internet.\n\nThe next part of the dailies information, gives you the effects of the roll. It shows the effects of each result of the die. On a roll of one, you don’t destroy the enemy and click the “Damage!” habit. On a roll of six, you succeed in destroying the enemy, and can click that you’ve done that daily. Also on a roll of six, you click the “Loot!” habit. On a roll in between these two numbers, the effects depend on the daily.\n\nThere are multiple ways to improve your rate of success with this die roll. For each level you have gained in a stat, that is divisible by five, you may roll an additional die upon clicking a habit. You may pick whichever die result you wish among the different results. You may only pick one result. Another way to remember how many dice you roll for a habit is this; For each title you have obtained in an attribute (with the exception of “The Beginner”), you may roll an additional die.\n\nSome rewards purchased in D&D affiliated challenges may change combat in other ways.\n\n## Public challenge\n[Way to the solstice](https://habitica.com/challenges/d14b3a80-4c48-4535-9331-c0042305cfc7)",

      "description":"Voice acting can be hard to get into, so talking with people who have experience is an important way to get better. \nSome rules:\n+ Follow the Habitica rules. \n+ Be respectful to each other. Getting started in something competitive like this is hard, even without people tearing each other down, or getting jealous. \n+ Self-promotion is allowed, just don't spam. \n+ If you're running a casting call, linking your posts is allowed. I'm not equipped to let you run a casting call through Habitica. You'll also get a larger pool going through an official website. \n___\n\nExperienced voice actors, this group isn't just for people new to voice over. Share what you're doing (If you're allowed of course). Offer advice if needed, make a challenge if you want. You might learn some things too!\n\nNew voiceover artists, feel free to ask questions! It can be hard to know how to start out. Share what you're doing too, if you have projects. \n___\n\nResources:\n\nAudacity- an open source sound editing and recording program. It's free and easy to use. Important to have for Librivox. \n\nhttps://librivox.org - a place to record and listen to free audio books of classic works. They also have forums where you ask to read parts of a story. People are very willing to help you get started there.\n\nhttps://castingcall.club - a free website to audition for volunteer (or sometimes paid) voice over work. A very popular place to get started. Look here if you're interested in comic dubs, youtube animations, and fan work. \n\nhttp://madivapodcast.buzzsprout.com/ - A good podcast about how to get started, especially if you're looking at becoming a professional. \n\nhttps://mandy.com - recommended by madiva podcast. It's a website for professional and semi professional VAs to have a profile, post demo reels, and audition. \n\nhttps://iwanttobeavoiceactor.com/- Written by Dee Bradley Baker. This website has a range of resources and FAQs for learning to be a voice actor. \n\nhttp://voiceacting.boards.net/- The official forums for the Voice Acting Club. There are VAs there with a range of different experience levels, and sometimes casting calls. VAC also has a discord!\n\n[Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/)- a free audio editing software that's more robust than Audacity. Also more complex. \n\n\n",

      "description":"# **LETS SET THE MOOD:**\n- There is a companion party to this guild constantly questing as well. Its very new so if you would like to start small message me.\n- Anyone can create challenges in this guild.\n\n## **Who Am I?**\nAs you may have guessed Amelia Emaleth Casper is not my real name, but is the name I write under for fun- all three names are ghosts in history or literature in some way. I work as an IT Project Manager. Work/Life balance is a major issue. Im double whammied. On the up-side, I'm constantly at my computer so this guild is definitely active, just new! I work remote. \n\n## **Why This Guild?**\n1.  **I've learned that sharing is key to self care. The pandemic, being a single mom of one adhd adult child and one adhd/asd young child, divorce and being 49 have led to a chaotic time with my own GAD symptoms too. Im taking advantage of every feature Habitica has right now.\n2. **Neurodivergence means our methodologies are different.** Normal tips and tricks just dont always apply and sometimes we have to work a little harder especially, I think, in the area of self care. If anything this guild is about finding balance within Neurodivergence. \n3. **I plan on being active.** Im going to post almost every day (give me a break sat-sun) these types of things and please do the same. Lets help and support each other! \n> 1. Polls (for fun or otherwise)\n> 2. Motivational Statements\n> 3. Quotes\n> 4. Shared Learnings\n> 5. Coping mechanisms for overcoming the \"overwhelmed\" feeling that renders most neurodivergent people useless until it subsides in some way.\n> 6.  Congratulate yourself! \"Guess what guys i did this and that and that and heres my new avatar!\". Congratulate others. \n> 7. Hive Mind - \"Hey guys- anyone have any tips for ...?\"",

There's a [list of tracker apps](https://www.androidauthority.com/best-fitness-tracker-apps-android-913959/) which you could use to help with counting calories based on your daily activities and how much weight you're planning to lose.\n\nFeeling the urge to snack! Don't worry! You should keep a bar of chocolate with you and consume around 100gm daily whenever you feel the lack or energy. You also have around 200 to 300 kcal daily to spare on fatty snacks (like an ice cream, or a slice of cake). And if that's not enough, it's safe to nibble on fresh fruits and vegetables, any from this list of [healthy portion of snacks](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a19959160/best-healthy-snacks-for-weight-loss/) or anything that is fat-free.\n\nOh yeah, ignore all of the above if you have to feed your kids. I mean, who feels like preparing different sets of meals, right?",

      "description":"Welcome to the Party Wanted Guild! We recommend reading our [FAQ](https://habitica.com/static/faq) to learn a bit more about Parties and how to find them. Here are some more tips for finding a Party or Party members:\n\n- **Let Party leaders know you’re looking to join**: On web, you can add yourself to a list of players looking for Party by selecting “Party” in the navigation and choosing “Look for a Party”. You’ll be added to a list of players that Party leaders can view and send invitations from.\n\n- **Party leaders can see a list of players looking for Party**: On web, Select “Find Members” from the Party dropdown in the navigation. This will display a convenient list of players that are actively looking for a Party and can be invited to join.\n\n- **This Guild is supplementary to the looking for Party list**: While we recommend looking for a Party and new members with the list, leaders can advertise their Party here for any solo players that are looking for a Party that fits their specific play style. Mobile support for the list is coming soon!\n\n- **How to send invitations with @usernames**: You can invite people using their @username that is displayed on all their posts. Copy it then go to your Party, click \"Invite\", and then paste it in. You can add multiples at once with one @username in each line, then click \"Send Invites\".\n\n- **You can use any language** to post to this Guild - you don't have to use English!\n\n- **If you want a non-English language Party**, you can also post to the [Party Wanted International](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/db4819dd-0efb-4290-989c-9f7625b59a3a) Guild where you can ask for a Party in any language except English.\n\n- **Don't ask people to send a private message (PM) to someone else** when you advertise your party. The person accepting PMs must post the party ad themself. \n\n- **Don't post here to advertise your party more than once every 24 hours.**\n\n- **Don't advertise Guilds or Challenges here.** You can use [The Bulletin Board](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/d6295936-7106-41d4-b90c-f22bdca3303b) for that.\n\n- **For questions about how to use Habitica**, post to the [Habitica Help: Ask a Question](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/5481ccf3-5d2d-48a9-a871-70a7380cee5a) Guild. Don't ask them here, not even questions about how to use a Party or do Quests.\n\n- **Don’t ask people to give you Gems or Subscriptions and don't offer to give people Gems or Subscriptions if they join your party.** Begging for real money items is a breach of the Community Guidelines, and offering gifts in your Party may encourage people to join and leave quickly. \n\n\nIf you are a Party leader wanting to get or share tips about running a party, you may like to join one or more of these Guilds:\n+ [Party Leaders Discussion Guild](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/dc4d8588-486f-4ace-87a5-1517e68217a1)\n+ [Habitica Party Roster Meeting Room](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/5189073f-56cd-4e2b-9cb6-817567371887)\n+ [Guild Leaders & Challenge Creators](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/0393624e-65f0-40c1-8e87-360955fcebca)",

This is where you can complete tasks asking you to share in the chat and just hang out with some nice people.\n\n___\n\n### Guild Rules:\n\n1. **Please be aware of and follow the Community Guidelines.** Positivity is rad. Kindness is rad. Empathy is rad. Be a rad person when posting in the chat, and when interacting with others.\n\n2. **This guild and its chat are a No Diet Talk Zone.** Your preeminent guild leader is trying to create a welcoming space for everyone, including people who are harmed by diet culture. This No Diet Talk rule includes, but it not limited to, talking about: dieting, weight loss, food restriction (mentions of fasting for religious reasons is okay), **specific body weights**, and \"good\" or \"bad\" foods or eating behaviours. There may be ongoing challenges that ask you to share future goals, current successes, and skills you are working on. Please ensure that what you are sharing in the guild chat follows this No Diet Talk rule. The guild leader eszipf with notify individuals who break this rule, and those individuals will be ineligible for the prize of any Heart and Hearth challenge they are currently participating in.\n\n3. **Try to combine multiple posts into one post.** If you are responding to multiple people or fulfilling multiple chats prompts at once, consider combining those all into one post, as the guild chat only holds 200 messages. To separate the parts of the post, you can put in line breaks or use markdown to put in horizontal lines (type a blank line, then three dashes --- or three underscores ___, then another blank line.) More details at the Markdown Cheat Sheet [here.](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Markdown_Cheat_Sheet)\n\n4. **Rules for individual challenges can be found on the specific challenge pages.**\n\nA reminder: **participating in these challenges should never hurt you!** Mentally, physically, emotionally, financially...if a task is not for you, do something else and check it off. I promise there's no Spanish inquisition.\n\n",

      "description":"# Bienvenue !\n\nUne guilde francophone dédiée aux personnes atteintes de TSA manquait cruellement à Habitica. La voilà !\nN'hésitez pas à parler de vos problèmes du quotidien ou poser des questions si vous souhaitez simplement vous informer.\n\n\n\n## Ressources\n\nQue vous soyez diagnostiqué.e ou non, de nombreux sites et tout autant d'institutions pourront vous aider autant dans vos démarches ponctuelles que dans votre vie de tous les jours. En voici quelque uns, et si vous en avez d'autres en tête, n'hésitez surtout pas à les indiquer dans le tchat de guilde : je les ajouterai !\n\n\n**Se renseigner**\n\nLes CRA, Centres Ressources Autisme, existent dans chaque région. Ils proposent, comme leur nom l'indique, moult ressources : des livres ou revues, des entretiens avec ou sans rendez-vous avec des assistants sociaux, des événements et interventions pour sensibiliser et faire comprendre l'autisme...\nVoici le lien du [CRAIF](https://www.craif.org/), le Centre Ressources Autisme d'Ile-de-France, sur lequel vous trouverez beaucoup d'informations, une bibliothèque en ligne et même un annuaire d'autres structures liées à l'autisme.\nLe [GNCRA](https://gncra.fr/), ou Groupement Nationnal des Centres Ressources Autisme, propose également de nombreuses ressources en ligne. Il vous permettra en outre de trouver le Centre Ressources Autisme le plus proche de chez vous.\n\n\n**Se faire diagnostiquer**\n\nSeul un médecin psychiatre peut diagnostiquer un TSA de manière officielle. Un psychologue peut cependant largement aider à effectuer les différents tests et entretiens. Si vous n'avez pas la possibilité de payer d'éventuels dépassements d'honoraires ou des séances de psychologues, dirigez-vous vers un CMP - Centre Médico-Psychologique - qui vous proposera des séances gratuites, mais une attente possiblement longue.\nVoici un lien qui répertorie tous les CMP de France par région. Il y en a forcément un non loin de chez vous ! [Santé en France](https://www.santeenfrance.fr/annuaire/13-centres-medico-psychologiques-cmp-cattp)\n\n\n**Se faire aider**\n\nÊtre aidé.e ne veut pas dire être un.e incapable. Tout le monde a besoin d'être aidé, à son niveau et à sa manière. Les TSA peuvent grandement influer sur l'autonomie d'une personne ; en outre, de nombreux autres troubles sont comorbides (c'est-à-dire que les personnes atteintes de TSA ont plus de chance d'en souffrir). La dépression, le trouble déficitaire de l'attention avec ou sans hyperactivité, les troubles anxieux, les troubles de l'alimentation et d'autres encore. Toujours est-il que vivre avec l'autisme n'est pas toujours facile.\nMon conseil personnel : tournez-vous vers un CRA pour effectuer une demande à la MDPH (Maison Départementale des Personnes Handicapées). Oui, l'autisme peut être un handicap ; ça ne fait pas de vous une personne moins importante ou diminuée. C'est simplement que certaines situations de la vie de tous les jours ne sont pas adaptées à votre fonctionnement.\nEnvoyer son dossier à la MDPH se fait après un diagnostic, mais le mieux reste de se laisser guider par une personne travaillant dans un CRA. Iel vous indiquera toutes les étapes et les démarches, vous listera ce à quoi vous pouvez prétendre. Entre autres, une RQTH (Reconnaissance en Qualité de Travailleur Handicapé) qui sert surtout, un peu froidement, à vous privilégier pour un emplois grâce à des quotas imposés aux entreprises ; l'AAH (Allocation Adulte Handicapé) ou, si vous avez moins de 20 ans, la PCH (Prestation de Compensation du Handicap) ; et, à mon avis le plus utile, un suivi SAMSAH (Service d'Accompagnement Médico-Social pour Adultes Handicapés) qui vous permet l'accès à de nombreux professionnels spécialisés (psychologues, psychiatres, assistants sociaux, éducateurs, kinésithérapeutes, ergologues, etc) au cours d'un suivi totalement adapté à vos besoins.\n\n\n\n## Autres guildes\n\n- [Autistic Adventurer's Guild](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/a205dd09-4578-438b-a87a-275aa2461f2e), une guilde destinée au personnes atteintes de TSA, mais anglophone !\n- [Boulevard Francophone](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/3e116e70-ae93-4c62-a7a1-cff8c87a3df3), la plus grosse guilde francophone d'Habitica !\n- [Les Forgemots](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/a65d65bf-c8f2-44ba-acf9-ec14bffe95ec), guilde d'écrivains en tous genre (nouvellistes, blogueurs, écrivains de romans ou autre).\n- [Petits Pas Anti-Procrastination](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/8e858862-255f-47b6-94b9-c2fac22befb7), que son nom présente très largement !\n- [Santé & Bien-Être](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/fc99098c-7a95-45b4-bdba-1304011f2c8c), guilde destinée à (devinez...) la santé et au bien-être. Très utile autant pour se sortir de situations d'addictions que pour commencer une routine plus saine.\n- [Mon beau jardin](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/5b732e36-33b8-4ab2-9566-8e132c485737), roi des forêts ~ Guilde destinée aux jardiniers en herbe !\n- [TDA/H Francophone](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/02f56c54-13e9-475e-ac51-3bd1e49d8563), une guilde très bienveillante destinée aux personnes atteintes de Troubles Déficitaire de l'Attention avec ou sans Hyperactivité. C'est en voyant cette guilde que je me suis dit qu'il en manquait une pour les personnes atteintes de TSA !\n- [French Translator Guild](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/f553b2a5-a462-4dbd-b89f-d41281703903) pour celles et ceux qui aimeraient récompenser ce chouette site avec un peu de leur temps et de leur savoir !\n- [Learning French - Apprendre le Français](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/3272dfab-2b42-4ccd-ab12-eeeb4aed63ad), parfaite guilde si vous vous sentez l'âme d'un ou d'une professeur.e ! \n\n\n\n## Aimez-vous comme vous êtes !\n\nN'ayez pas peur de vous faire aider. Et si vous allez mal pour une raison ou une autre, parlez-en dans la guilde. En retour, répondez et soutenez ceux qui ont besoin d'aide. Habitica a une communauté extrêmement bienveillante ; aidons-nous, soutenons-nous mutuellement :)",

But if you judge a fish on its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing it's stupid.\"  \n-Albert Einstein\n\n\"The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing.\"\n\n---\n\n---\n\n# Welcome!\n\nCongratulations! I'm Head of House CatieWinter, and I'm delighted to welcome you to Ravenclaw House. Our emblem is the eagle, which soars where others cannot climb; our house colours are blue and bronze, and our common room is found at the top of Ravenclaw Tower, behind a door with an enchanted knocker. The arched windows set into the walls of our circular common room look down at the school grounds: the lake, the Forbidden Forest, the Quidditch pitch and the Herbology gardens. No other house in the school has such stunning views.  \n(However, if you want to see these views, you will have to find someone willing to share their chair). \n\n---\n\nCreative, sharp-minded, witty, and clever. You are an all-round intellectual person. You have great skill when it comes to academics, and chances are you will be a very successful person too. You are polite, patient but at times you tend to be a bit shy or soft-spoken. Even if you are not all of these things, we are glad to have you. \n\n---\n\nRavenclaws love leather-bound books and overstocked libraries. They're waking up at two a.m. to google that thing that's bugging them. They're journals with half the words crossed out, scribbles and ink stains and missing pages. They're stretching when you've been hunched over all day, rolling off the edge of a bed, burrowing in blankets. They're torchlight and held breaths and reverent whispers. They're the entire night sky and everything beyond it; the embodiment of the universe. They're desperate searches and hidden castles and ghost stories by firelight. They're the mystery of a dark corridor, the force of a whirlwind. They're the excitement of discovery, the rustle of crunched up paper. They're the last whisper before you fall asleep.  \n\n---\n\n**A Ravenclaw is a Person:**  \n- Who has intelligence, but is not necessarily good at schoolwork.  \n- Who enjoys intellectual conversations and thrives on discussion.  \n- Who has an analytical, curious mind; they constantly question.  \n- Who tends to observe more than participate in life.   \n- Who are highly introspective and independent.  \n- Who likes learning for the sake of learning.  \n- Who has an extremely selective work ethic.  \n- Who is logical, yet can be impractical.  \n- Who is not necessarily unemotional.  \n- Who is creative, witty, and wise.  \n- Who is not necessarily words.  \n- Who has a resigned cynicism.  \n\n---\n\n---\n\n## Common Room Rules\n\n- Never disturb anyone who is reading or writing.\n- Nobody is inferior to you, and you are not inferior to anybody.\n- Good humor, clear thinking, and realism are essential for doing work. \n- Never give advice where it is not needed.\n- Do not be afraid to question.\n- Keep your mind open to all points of view.\n- Do not judge others by their creative outlets. \n- If anybody needs feedback or someone to listen to them, let them have your time. \n---\n\n## General Stuff To Know\n\nIf you have suggestions for challenges, please post here and someone will make your wish come true, just as if it were magic (which it is :wink: )\n\nChatting is always encouraged, so feel free to chat, share, and encourage your fellow Ravenclaws. Please be respectful of your language, as there are many kinds of people here. \n\n**If responding to a riddle posted by someone, please PM them with what you think the answer is. This gives others the chance to answer if they don't come on before you answer (Ex. I came on one time to see a new riddle, but someone had already said the answer. I saw the answer before the riddle, so I didn't get the chance to guess). Of course, if you need some help, or many people are stuck, feel free to discuss.** \n\n---\n\n---\n\n## Prefect News\n\nHello Everyone! Our current prefects can be found on the common room bulletin board ~~guild summary~~. Occasionally new prefects are chosen. There will be a challenge, and the winner will become prefect. Please message me (@CatieWinter) with any questions. \n\n---\n\n---\n\n## Quidditch News:\n\n### We are not currently playing in quidditch.

      "description":"[//]: # (Every day, a new 2-30 minute challenge will appear, covering a variety of fun topics. All are welcome, let's have some fun!)  \n\nClimate Defenders are those who take steps large and small to slow global warming and climate change.  It's a new old guild: it had been for daily challenges for fun but then its creator had to step back and gave permission for the guild to go in a different direction.  Many thanks to Hutchruns (@hutchXC) for having worked hard to lead the guild well.  Although the purpose of the guild has changed, at least for now let's keep two of its earlier traditions:  \n**Word Wednesday** Every Wednesday post a word you've learned or find interesting, along with its definition.  \n**Fun Fact Friday**  Every Friday post some interesting fact you've come across or happen to know.  \nAt present the only reward is the simple joy of sharing the fun - but isn't that enough?\n\n### **What to do**\n\n1. Find and join the challenge - @Acorn_Sprout will type it in chat, and you can also find it in the guild's challenge (or through \"Discover Challenges)\n\n2. Complete the challenges if you can, or just take inspiration from them.\n\n3. Talk about the challenge - share your findings, share what you did, etc.\n\n4. Respond to others: Just chat! This is an open space to talk about anything under then sun, but it has to follow the community guidelines, as stated below.\n\n---\n\n### **Rules**\n\n1. Please follow the [community guidelines](https://habitica.com/static/community-guidelines). Be kind and respectful to others, and offer words of encouragement!\n\n2. When possible, source your facts.  That is, instead of saying, \"I heard X\" or \"Y is true\" include a reference so any claims can be fact-checked.  If you don't have a source you can still post, but recognize that then your post will be in the opinion category.  Wikipedia is handy and *usually* correct, but it is a stepping-stone to facts.  If you can, supplement any such references with additional sources.  I'm not sure who first said it, but I like the quip, \"Saying 'It's true because I read it on the internet' is like saying 'It's true because I heard it on the telephone.' \"\n\n3. Have Fun!!  @Hutchruns had a lot of fun creating this guild.  I'm enjoying leading it, and we both hope you all like it too.\n\n---\nAt least for the time being, feel free to start a challenge, assuming it is appropriate to the spirit of the guild.  Gem rewards are optional.  Tasks should not merely say something like \"post in the guild\" (Really? Which guild?) but rather have a link.  Use this example to create links:  \n`Share a fun fact in [Climate Defenders](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/f772e3fe-2914-42f5-bbc4-bf96257c047b)`  \nThe pattern is `[`What you want people to see`](`URL of the guild or of the challenge`)`  \nNote that there is no space between the closing square bracket and the opening parenthesis.  \nConsider copying the symbol 🛡️ into the name of the challenge to make it easy to find amid other challenges.\n \n### **Suggest or Create a Challenge**\n\nTo suggest a challenge, message @Acorn_Sprout. The challenge must be (1) appropriate, (2) fun and/or engaging and/or useful and/or educational, and (3) applicable to most people. Not all suggested challenges will be used.\n\n### **Resources**\n[Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index](https://cbeci.org/)  \n[Carbon Brief](https://www.carbonbrief.org/)  \n[Carbone4](https://www.carbone4.com/) is primarily in French, but a few articles are in English.  \n[Climate 350](https://climate350.com/)  \n[Climate Connections](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/)  \n[The Climate Reality Project](https://www.climaterealityproject.org/)  \n[Fossil Free Media](https://fossilfree.media/)  \n[Global Weirding with Katherine Hayhoe](https://www.youtube.com/c/GlobalWeirdingwithKatharineHayhoe/videos)\n[NASA: Global Climate Change](https://climate.nasa.gov/)  \n[Skeptical Science](https://skepticalscience.com/)  \n[yes!](https://www.yesmagazine.org/)  \n\n### **Outside Organizations of Interest**\n[Citizens' Climate Lobby](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/)  \n[Climate Strike](https://www.climatestrike.net/)  \n[Earth Justice (because the earth needs a good lawyer)](https://earthjustice.org)  \n[Extinction Rebellion](https://rebellion.global/) (\"XR\")  \n[Fridays for Future](https://fridaysforfuture.org/)  \n\n\n### **Articles and Information Mentioned in Chat** (linked here to keep them from scrolling away; these may not remain permanently)   \n[Increasing precipitation variability on daily-to-multiyear time scales in a warmer world](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/31/eabf8021)   \n[Doing Your Fair Share for the Climate?](https://www.carbone4.com/publication-doing-your-fair-share?lang=en)   \n[Critical measures of global heating reaching tipping point, study finds](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/27/global-heating-critical-measures-tipping-point-study)   \n[Les «signes vitaux» de la Terre s’affaiblissent](https://www.20min.ch/fr/story/les-signes-vitaux-de-la-terre-saffaiblissent-903944696036)\n[World Scientists’ Warning of a Climate Emergency 2021](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/advance-article/doi/10.1093/biosci/biab079/6325731)   \n[Making Sense of Climate Denial (EdX MOOC)](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UQx+Denial101x+1T2019/851dabd8ceef4734b57dce9d6d77b2d4/)  \n[Indigenous Resistance Against Carbon](https://www.ienearth.org/indigenous-resistance-against-carbon/)  \n[From anger to action: Differential impacts of eco-anxiety, eco-depression, and eco-anger on climate action and wellbeing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667278221000018?via%3Dihub)  \n[Environmental Impacts of Food](https://ourworldindata.org/environmental-impacts-of-food)  \n[Poore & Nemecek manuscript on  food’s environmental impacts](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:b0b53649-5e93-4415-bf07-6b0b1227172f/download_file?file_format=pdf&safe_filename=Reducing_foods_environment_impacts_Science%2B360%2B6392%2B987%2B-%2BAccepted%2BManuscript.pdf&type_of_work=Journal+article)  \n\n\n### **Related Guilds**  \n[inHabitants of Earth: the eco-friendly guild](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/9b8989b7-73e9-4904-af1a-77e34e7b8094): Saving our World in numerous and varied ways  \n\n[Eco Resilience 🌍](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/0615c66b-3199-4282-8e92-16c2116d9da6): Focus on Permaculture, Natural Building, Primitive Skills, Slow Food *et c.*  \n\n---\n\n### **Challenge of the Day Legacy Hall of Fame**\n\n@\\_APIS_ (x2)  \n@IAmProductive  \n@lemonysplitt\n\n---\nMany thanks and great honor to @hutchXC for having previously led the guild valiantly into January 2021.\n\nA special thanks to @TheLastHabitican for your support on the Challenge of the Day project :)\n\n*This guild was created on 9/30/20*",

      "description":"If you're unfamiliar with how Habitica works, I'll describe it in a nutshell.\n\nThis app turns your life into a video game. How? First you want to think about what you're trying to accomplish here.\n\nAre you a complete noob who needs to get their life together? Might want to start by adding some basic life tasks like brushing/flossing every day, doing laundry once a week, or clearing out that absolutely disgusting sink full of dirty dishes.\n\nMaybe you're a little more advanced but not quite expert and you want to start exercising every day, add value adding habits like get up every 15 minutes from your computer chair and walk around (trivial), practice an instrument or whatever you're trying to get better at for 10 minutes (easy), read 2-3 chapters of a book (medium), or maybe even practice approaching an attractive person and starting up a conversation with them (hard).\n\nThese are all just suggestions, obviously some tasks will be easier to me than they will be to others. The ones I listed above are personal habits that I'm trying to work on and since I'm an introvert who has never been good at approaching women, I list that as hard because well....for me it is. For some people that might be an easy task, or not even on the radar of Habitica.\n\nI am a big fan of joking around but the biggest rule in my guild is to treat other members with respect (you never know who will turn out to be a great friend or a valuable collaborator in life) and don't say anything explicitly homophobic, racist, or sexist. We are trying to make the world a better place here, starting with US (us not the usa).",

Drawing every day, even a small thing, will make you better over time and the more you do it, the better you get!\n\n**Just like you don't need to be a chef to cook a decent meal, or a musician to play a good song, you don't need to be an artist to draw well.** You just need to practice, fail, fix your mistakes, and get better. Don't be embarrassed if you're not a great artist or particularly fond of your drawing, we all start somewhere. There will always be a learning curve but if you stick with it, you will improve, I guarantee it! \n\nMonday through Friday a sketch subject will be suggested, you can use that as inspiration or choose your own thing to draw. Saturday and Sunday are Free Draw days. Post to the community for advice or to show off your work! Try and find 10 minutes a day to put a pen to paper. Don't feel bad if you miss a day or two, but try and make it a habit to draw, even just a little bit! \n\n# [Check out our discord server!](https://discord.gg/XSWze5W)\n\n`To post a link, upload your image to an image hosting site, then post [ text ] ( URL ) without the spaces.` \n\n-----\n\n# The August Theme is: \n# **Drawing from Within!**\n\nLast month we learned to draw the things we see around us, this month let's figure out how to draw what we see within ourselves. Let’s journey into our subconscious, challenge the boundaries of reality, embrace the surreal, and bring our dreams to life. This month we will defy physics, play with scale, and breathe life into the inanimate. So, unleash your imagination, let your dreams guide your hand, and remember, in this realm of creativity there are no boundaries. Welcome to this month of Drawing From Within!\n\n\n### **Art Tip of the Week:**\n\nPractice quick, gestural sketches to capture the essence of a scene or subject in limited time. Train yourself to sketch rapidly and capture basic shapes and gestures. Quick gestural sketches can help you capture the energy and immediacy of the moment.\n\n\n### **Featured Artist:**\nDavid Coleman is an incredibly skilled artist with a wide range of styles, techniques and mediums. he is best known for is [wonderfully expressive characters](http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b92/TheGABER/Guinness_sketches_by_davidsdoodles.jpg), fantastic [gesture poses](https://www.cartoonbrew.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Leapin_ape_post.jpg), and his constant [changing](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/59/76/7d/59767d4d61d05a25c2d1379ecaedd683.jpg) of [materials](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8ojYCeN-y3g/TSFK5nLhooI/AAAAAAAABoU/RwtM7-GYVIA/s1600/Colman_Eddie_post.jpg) and [technique](https://images.fineartamerica.com/images/artworkimages/mediumlarge/1/cat-in-hand-david-coleman.jpg). \n\n\n\n### Useful Websites\n\n[Art Prompts](http://artprompts.org/) - Ideas for drawings\n\n[Line of Action](https://line-of-action.com/) - Reference photos at set time intervals to draw from\n\n[Sketch Daily Reference](http://reference.sketchdaily.net/en/) - Similar to Line of Action, reference photos at set time intervals\n\n[QuickPoses](https://www.quickposes.com/en) - Similar to Line of Action but with much more dynamic poses and characters to choose from\n\n[Normand Lemay's drawing tips](http://www.theconceptartblog.com/2014/07/27/dicas-de-desenho-no-tumblr-de-griselda-sastrawinata/) - Basic people drawing tutorials.\n\n\nYou are also encouraged to keep an online blog of your daily sketches!

Looking to lose weight? Build muscle? Wondering what to eat? Or how much to eat? Have fitness goals? Want to run a 5k? Or see your abs? Or just become healthier in general? Then welcome, this is the spot for you!\n\nThis guild was created to offer a space where we can push back against profit-seeking internet fitness gurus, celebrities, low-quality journalists, dogmatic nutritional cults and other sources of harmful/misleading / pseudo-scientific information. Let us improve our bodies (and minds) in the name of science!\n\nCurrent challenges associated with this guild are:\n\n1.

This allows the Guild size to more accurately reflect its value to Habitica which, if below 5000 members, means that the Guild will get notifications of activity within the Guild. \n\nKudos to the previous Guild Leader - @Barnaby_Plankton !",

This way we won't knock off jokes from earlier in the challenge.\n\nAnyone may post a challenge. Often these are posted as Public Challenges so others can find our guild and join in the fun. \n\nOfficial wiki page listing previous challenge winners:\n[Habitica's Court Jesters' Challenge Winners](http://habitrpg.wikia.com/wiki/The_Keep:Habitica%27s_Court_Jesters)  \nQuick link to this guild for jesters who like circular arguments: [Habitica's Court Jesters](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/fddaeafc-125c-4b43-a339-14c1d37634e8)  \n\nYour jokes do not need to be original but please make sure you have permission to use them or that they're in the public domain.  \n",

No swearing! this is an all-ages group, and I would like to keep it clean!  \n2. No starting any Claw fights (Cat Vs. Cat) without telling me!  \n3. No killing other players!  \ndisobeying ANY of the rules will result in a kick.  \n~*Clans*~  \nDewClan \nLeader: @Spottedtail_warrior AKA BlossomStar. A young fluffy she-cat with a soft ginger pelt with dark orange Swirls and spots. she is kind and caring but watch out! she will become feisty if anyone threatens her friends or family. She loves leading her clan, but sometimes gets confused, and looks to her deputy for help.  \nDeputy: braveflame (NPC ask to become new dep.) An orange tom with black stripes and a long scar across his face. He is cold, and does not like to show emotions.  \nMed cat:\nWarriors:\nSedgebreeze: (NPC) A big, wiry she-cat. Her fur is silver-gray, with a white mark on her forehead. It is dense and extremly long. She has a round face with narrow blue-grey eyes. She has a croaky voice and a herbal scent. Sedgebreeze has long whiskers. She is considered intimidating by most, especially in other Clans.  \nSilentmoon (NPC): a little, wiry she-cat. Her fur is black and brown with a spotted tabby pattern. It is shaggy and extremely long. She has a square face with narrow amber eyes. She has a rough voice and a sour scent. Silentmoon has unusually long claws. She is considered fearsome by most, especially in her own Clan.\nCrowflame (NPC): a big, wiry tom. His fur is dark yellow, with white feather-shaped splashes. It is shaggy and very short. He has a round face with round honey yellow eyes. He has a resonant voice and a spicy scent. Crowflame has a very long tail. He is considered to have unusual looks by most, especially in other Clans.  \n@ravenpaw_ AKA Nightfall is a maine coon with a grey-black gradient of fur. She has stunning, sky blue eyes, that are always glowing with determination. She's strict and she cannot allow constant failure--since one failure during her apprentice years made her almost lose her hind legs from a rough jump off a vine to another. She tries her best to serve her clan, she has a kind heart, and she's so hard on apprentices to make sure they don't do the wrongs she did.  \n(ran out of inspiration. will edit later)  \nQueens:  \nApprentices:  \nkits:  \n \nSwiftClan\nLeader: \nDeputy:  \nMed cat:\nWarriors:\nQueens:  \nApprentices:  \nKits:  \n  \nBrookClan  \nLeader: \nDeputy:  \nMed cat:\nWarriors:\nQueens:  \nApprentices:  \nKits:  \n  \nBeachClan  \nLeader: \nDeputy:  \nMed cat:\nWarriors:\nQueens:  \nApprentices:  \nKits:  \n  \nTerritories:\nDewClan: A leafy forest with lots of sunlight. their territory is on the top right corner of the island where all the clans live. their camp is in a clearing in the forest.  \nSwiftClan: a large, empty plain where the cats can run around freely. Their territory is at the bottom left corner of the island. their camp is under a large hill where they dug out tunnels to live in.  \nBrookClan: A nice bushy area with a few trees here and there. their territory is in the top left corner of the island. their camp is next to a brook where they drink their water.  \nBeachClan: a sandy area next to the ocean where they catch lots of fish. their territory is in the bottom right corner of the island. their camp is next to the ocean, in a flat area.  \n",

Dari banyaknya topik yang bisa diangkat, berikut ada beberapa saran :\n\n- *Ceritakan tujuan dan kendalamu dalam mencapainya.*  \nJalan panjang dan berliku menuju produktivitas tidak harus dilalui sendirian dan jadi perjalanan yang sulit.

Lontarkan saja\n\n&nbsp;\n\n___\n\n    Kisah League of Indonesian Habiticans\n___\n\n&ensp; &ensp; Pada zaman dahulu, kapal ini dikenal dengan nama **Nabors Advisory**. Setelah terapung tanpa arah entah berapa lama, kapal ini ditemukan para Bajak Laut. Singkat cerita, pada 27 Februari 2016 **Veruchka** mengambil alih kemudi dan berlayar dengan nama baru yang masih dipakai hingga sekarang. Beberapa tahun kemudian, sang kapten semakin jarang kembali. Para awak kapal akhirnya memutuskan untuk menunjuk kapten baru.\n\n&ensp; &ensp;\nKapal ini kemudian dipimpin oleh Kapten [@HawkEye_](https://habitica.com/profile/a1bcee1e-77a7-45c5-af83-79abc6f212f9) sampai 20 Mei 2023 pukul 06:45 WIB.

Come on in and say hello!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWelcome Benders! If you want to know what Nation you belong to, [here's a quiz to find out!](https://uquiz.com/Fy7VST?p=92697) (this isn't anything official, don't take it too seriously)\n___\n**To read:**\n[Avatar: The Last Airbender on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/shelf/show/atla-comics)\n___\nThe four Nations Challenges you'll see below are just meant to be supplemental to your Task list; they only have two habits each. Join whichever ones and however many you like!\n___\nFeel free to discuss anything (Especially the show, of course!) Or suggest any ideas for Challenges!\n___\nHere is a long term challenge [Avatar Bending Challenges](https://habitica.com/challenges/cf143c82-5325-41b8-8de4-8290c2079055)  made by our guild member [@Vvater_Vveaver](https://habitica.com/profile/a6536268-b594-44cc-86a5-82955b92228d) .\n\nYou can create challenges too and there is no requirement to use gems when creating challenges.\n",
